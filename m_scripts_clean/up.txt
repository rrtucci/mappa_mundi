Spotlight on Adventure!
The mysterious SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE.
A massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain.
What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South America!
Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science.
Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit?
A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer.
Why, our subject today: Charles Muntz!
A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield.
The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the "Spirit of Adventure," in New Hampshire this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world!
Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.
This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy- wagons placed end to end.
Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.
And here comes the adventurer now!
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd.
His dogs trail him.
Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort!
It is a veritable floating palace in the sky...
An opulent dining room.
...complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker.
One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.
And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees!
And how!
Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature "thumbs up" stance.
"Adventure is out there!"
In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.
But what has Muntz brought back this time?
Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object.
Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls!
He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.
Ooh!
Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.
And golly, what a swell monster this is.
But what is this?
Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.
Scientists cry foul!
The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton!
Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers.
The organization strips Muntz of his membership.
Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED from his jacket.
Carl GASPS.
Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.
He grimly addresses the crowd.
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive!
I promise to capture the beast... alive!
In the theater, young Carl smiles.
And I will not come back until I do!
The crowd CHEERS.
Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible lifts off.
And so the explorer is off to clear his name.
Bon voyage Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls!
Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.
Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
He still wears helmet and goggles.
Here is Charles Muntz piloting his famous dirigible!!
He hurdles Pike's Peak!
Carl jumps over a small rock.
He hurdles the Grand Canyon!
Carl jumps over a crack in the sidewalk.
He hurdles Mount Everest!
Carl jumps over a tree stump... and smacks into it instead.
He... goes around Mount Everest!
Is there nothing he cannot do?
Yes, as Muntz himself says: "Adventure is--" "Adventure is out there!"
Carl stops.
Who said that?
The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up and lawn overgrown with weeds.
The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.
Look out!
Mount Rushmore!
Hard to starboard.
Must get the Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore...
Carl walks toward the voice.
Hold together old girl.
How are my dogs doing?
Ruff ruff!
Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.
He follows the voice toward the living room.
All engines ahead full!
Let us take her up to 26,000 feet!
Rudders eighteen degrees towards the south.
Carl rounds the corner to see...
ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles.
Bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty.
The old house has been transformed into a make-believe dirigible cockpit.
Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle.
It is a beautiful day, winds out of the east at ten knots.
Visibility... unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook!
The navigator  skitters in its cage.
Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.
Oh!
There is something down there!
I will bring it back for science.
Awwww, it is a puppy!
Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall.
No time!
A storm!
Lightning!
Hail!
Ellie pops up in front of Carl.
What are you doing!?!
Carl screams.
He let us go of his balloon.
It floats through a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.
Ellie circles Carl accusingly.
Do not you know this is an exclusive club?
Only explorers get in here.
Not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles.
Do you think you got what it takes?
Well, do you?!?
Carl FUMPHERS.
Alright, you are in.
Welcome aboard.
She offers her hand.
Carl looks down, embarrassed.
What is wrong?
Cannot you talk?
Carl is frozen.
Ellie softens.
Hey, I do not bite.
She takes off her helmet.
Her hair frizzes out in all directions.
She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl.
You and me, we are in a club now.
Carl smiles.
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on, let us go get it!
Carl watches her stride out of the room.
She pops back in.
My name's Ellie.
She grabs his hand.
Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.
There it is.
Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon.
Between them the floor has collapsed, savedag one rickety beam.
Carl GULPS.
Well, go ahead.
She pushes him out onto the beam.
Go on.
Carl steels his courage.
He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor.
Ambulance.
SIREN blaring.
One lone light on upstairs.
Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.
Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.
Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.
A head pops up from outside the open window.
Hey kid!!
Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.
Ellie climbs in the window.
Thought you might need a little cheerin' up.
I got something to show ya!
The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.
Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.
I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being.
Ever.
In my life.
Carl's eyes widen in alarm.
You will have to swear you will not tell anyone.
Carl nods.
Cross your heart.
Do it!
Carl crosses.
Ellie unveils...
My Adventure Book!
It is a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book" written across it.
She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.
You know him.
Carl smiles excitedly.
Charles Muntz, explorer.
When I get big, I am going where he is going: South America.
She turns the page to a map.
It is like America... but south.
Want To know where I am going to live?
She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall.
A small hand- drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
I ripped this right out of a library book.
Carl GASPS in horror.
I am going to move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls.
Who knows what lives up there?
And once I get there...
She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF I AM GOING TO DO."
Past that, the pages are blank.
Well, I am saving these pages for all the adventures I am going to have.
Only...
I just do not know how I am going to get to Paradise Falls.
Ellie closes the book, disappointed.
Carl has a thought.
He looks at his toy dirigible.
That is it!
You can take us there in a blimp!
Swear you will take us.
Cross your heart!
Cross it!
Cross your heart.
Carl does.
Good.
You promised.
No backing out.
Carl shakes his head "no."
Well, see you tomorrow kid!
Bye.
Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.
"Adventure is out there!!"
She pops back in.
You know, you do not talk very much.
I like you.
Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.
He rests his head on his balloon.
Wow.
The balloon pops.
FLASH!
A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and Ellie, now 19.
She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.
Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.
A gun shot is fired in the air.
Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.
Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.
It is the same house where they met as kids.
Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.
They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.
Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX.
Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint handprint on the mailbox!
Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint as well.
They smile.
Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING from her childhood Adventure Book.
They run up a hillside together.
They lie side by side on a picnic blanket.
She describes the clouds.
He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle.
Carl closes his eyes and smiles.
He is lucky to be with her.
Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her Zookeeper's uniform.
Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform.
Behind him the balloons lift his cart off the ground.
Carl jumps to catch it.
She giggles.
Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.
Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.
Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds.
Ellie sees an elephant with wings.
Carl gives it a try and points out a BABY.
Ellie lights up, excited.
She sees ALL the clouds as babies!
Carl is stunned... but smiles.
Ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a bundle in its beak.
Carl hangs a mobile above the crib.
Carl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.
Ellie drops her head in her hands.
Carl looks out the window.
Ellie sits alone under a tree, the wind in her hair.
Carl joins Ellie.
He hands her the Adventure Book.
She smiles.
Ellie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over the mantle.
Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and native bird figurine beneath the painting.
It is their shrine to Adventure.
Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.
Ellie drops in a few coins.
She looks at Carl and crosses her heart.
Carl crosses his.
The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.
Their car blows a tire.
The two stand by the jar, reluctant.
Carl BREAKS the jar.
New tire.
Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.
Breaking jar.
A storm rages.
A tree falls, crushing the roof.
Breaking jar.
Carl struggles to tie his tie.
Ellie helps.
They walk out the front door arm in arm.
Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.
A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.
Stylish 1950's ties.
Wide 60's ties.
Paisley 70's ties.
Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.
Carl in his 60's.
They still work happily side by side at the zoo.
Carl's cart lifts off the ground.
He casually leans an elbow on it.
Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight.
The PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and forgotten.
Carl cleans the inside of the window.
Ellie cleans the outside.
Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle.
Carl smiles at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and goggles.
He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise Falls.
His smile fades.
Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.
Their dream has gone unfulfilled.
Carl has an idea.
Carl buys two tickets to South America.
Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.
He hides the airline tickets in his basket.
Behind him, Ellie falters and falls.
She tries to get up but falls again.
Something is wrong.
He runs to her.
Ellie lies in a hospital bed.
She looks through her A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.
Carl stands at the door.
He smiles and walks to her bedside.
Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.
She weakly pats his cheek and adjusts his tie.
He kisses her on the forehead.
Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.
Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.
An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.
An aged hand shuts it off and picks up the nearby glasses.
CARL sits alone in his double bed.
He rubs his face.
GRUNTS.
He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.
He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes.
Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the staircase.
This takes a LONG, LONG time.
Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.
He bangs the armrest and the chair restarts.
Carl eats breakfast by himself.
Carl cleans the window with a cloth.
His lonely reflection stares back at him.
Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.
Carl looks in the hall mirror.
He puts on his hat and considers his reflection.
He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.
Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.
Carl GRUMBLES in frustration.
Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door shut, and looks as if he is about to go somewhere.
He sits in his porch chair.
Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not under construction.
Machinery and workers circle busily.
High rise buildings are being erected all around.
Carl looks at the activity around him.
Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
Uhp, mail's here.
Carl walks to the mailbox.
He touches Ellie's faded HANDPRINT and smiles.
He looks through the mail.
He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of images of happy old people.
Carl scoffs.
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh brother.
Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.
He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.
He revs it and blasts off the dust.
TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.
Hey!
`Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
Need any help there?
No.
Yes.
Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.
Well just to let you know, my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer.
Whaddya say to that?
The leaf blower blasts off his hat.
Uh, I take that as a no, then.
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.
Oh yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.
Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.
You in the suit.
Yes, you.
Take a bath, hippy!
Tom grabs the megaphone.
I am not with him!
This is serious.
He is out to get your house!
Carl walks to his front door.
Tell your boss he can have our house.
Really?
When I am dead!
Carl SLAMS the door.
I will take that as a maybe!
Carl sits in his chair watching TV.
A KNOCK at the door.
The door opens.
A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness Explorer Manual.
He is in uniform, complete with sash, neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is.
This is RUSSELL, age 8.
Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell.
And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12.
Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?"
As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.
I could help you cross the street.
I could help you cross your yard.
I could help you cross your... porch?
Well, I got to help you cross something.
Uh, no.
I am doing fine.
Carl closes the door in Russell's face.
Carl listens through the door.
Is the kid gone?
He opens it.
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell."
Uh... kid...
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."
Kid. KID!!
Russell stops... but goes back to reading.
"Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?"
Thank you, but I do not need any help!
Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.
Carl opens the door.
Russell stands at attention.
Proceed.
"Good afternoon.
My-"
But skip to the end!
Russell points to his SASH.
It is covered with badges except for one glaringly empty space.
See these?
These are my Wilderness Explorer badges.
You may notice one is missing.
It is my Assisting the Elderly badge.
If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer!
Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.
"The wilderness must be explored!
This sets Carl's hearing aid off.
Carl GRUMBLES in pain.
It is going to be great!
There is a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges...
So you want to assist an old person?
Yep!
Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer!
Carl leans in close to Russell.
You ever heard of a snipe?
Snipe?
Bird.
Beady eyes.
Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas.
I am elderly and infirm.
I cannot catch it.
If only someone could help me... Me! Me!
I will do it!
Oh, I do not know, it is awfully crafty.
You would have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.
I will find it, Mr. Fredricksen!
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past -- Two blocks down!
Got it!
Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.
Sniiiipe!
Here Snipey Snipey... Bring it back here when you find it!
Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.
He stops short.
A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to Okay, keep her coming... And... stop.
Stop! STOP!!
The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.
Carl is shocked.
He runs to the box.
What?
Hey!
Hey you!
What do you think you are doing?
I am so sorry, sir...
The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.
Do not touch that!
No no, let me take care of that for you.
Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.
Get away from our mailbox!
Hey sir, I...
I do not want you to touch it!
Carl HITS the worker with his cane.
He falls to the sidewalk.
The worker rubs his head.
Blood.
Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.
What has he done?
Passerbys stare.
Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.
Carl backs into his house.
Carl shuts his door.
He closes the curtains.
He peeks out the window.
The injured worker is helped to his feet.
A police car pulls up.
The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.
His hand rests on Carl's fence.
Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.
A GUARD opens the door.
Carl enters.
The REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER watches him enter.
A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.
Sorry Mr. Fredricksen.
You do not seem like a public menace to me.
Take this.
She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay?
The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.
Carl faces the house.
He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.
What do I do now, Ellie?
All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.
The empty hall.
The front hall mirror.
The kitchen.
Carl pulls out a suitcase.
A book tips over.
Ellie's Adventure Book.
Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.
He turns to the page marked "STUFF I AM GOING TO DO."
He closes the book and sighs.
Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their house by Paradise Falls.
He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.
Carl's brows furrow.
He looks up at the shrine, and crosses his heart.
Lights are on inside the house.
A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.
Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.
Carl answers, holding a suitcase.
Morning gentlemen.
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?
Ready as I will ever be.
Would you do me a favor and take this?
Carl hands over his suitcase.
I will meet you at the van in just a minute.
I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
Sure.
Take all the time you need, sir.
Carl closes the door.
Rather sharply.
The nurses head back to the van.
Typical.
He is probably going to the bathroom for the eightieth time.
Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.
You would think he would take better care of his house.
A SHADOW falls over the nurses.
They turn to look.
A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.
It unfolds to reveal The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.
Strings tug at the chimney.
The house strains.
Pipes bend, then break.
Electrical wires spark and snap.
The house rips away from its foundation.
The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.
Carl looks out the window and LAUGHS.
So long boys!
I will send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the house floats past.
The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.
A family watches the house float down the street.
Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively waves back.
The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away from the city.
Carl looks out his window.
Good riddance.
Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.
Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind.
Carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane.
The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.
The house turns.
Carl looks out the window, satisfied.
He checks the balloons.
Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.
We are on our way, Ellie.
Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate.
He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.
He closes his eyes and smiles.
SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.
The house drifts through the clouds.
Carl relaxes in his chair.
Huh?
He stares at the front door.
Nothing.
He bolts up and approaches the door.
He looks out the peep hole.
Nothing but the porch and clouds.
He throws it open.
Nothing.
He looks left.
Nothing.
He looks right.
Russell.
He looks...
Russell?!!
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
It is me, Russell.
What are you doing out here, kid?
Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life.
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through the clouds.
Please let me in?
Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.
Beat.
The door opens again.
Oh, alright, you can come...
Russell runs into the house past Carl.
...in.
Russell PANTS, panicked.
He looks into living room.
Huh.
I have never been in a floating house before.
Carl follows Russell into the living room.
Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie.
Goggles.
Look at this stuff!
Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas.
Wow, you going on a trip?
"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time."
You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?
Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.
Do not touch that.
You will soil it.
You know, most people take a plane, but you are smart because you will have all your TV and clocks and stuff.
Russell runs over to the steering rig.
Whoah.
Is this how you steer your house?
Does it really work?
Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth.
Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left.
Let go of the -- knock it off!
Russell looks out the window in front of him.
Hey look, buildings!
Russell and Carl arrive at the window.
That building's so close I could almost touch it.
That gives Carl an idea.
Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.
Wow!
This is great!
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen!
Look, there is a bus that could take me home two blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here!
Do not jerk around so much, kid!
The rope slips through Carl's hands.
Russell FALLS.
Carl stands beside Russell at the window.
Russell's fall had been a daydream.
Well, that is not going to work.
Carl leaves Russell at the window.
I know that cloud, it is a Cumulo Nimbus.
Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus... GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon strings with his housekeys.
Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what?
...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that is how we get lightning.
That is nice, kid.
Carl turns off his hearing aid.
Silence.
He smiles.
Russell tries to get Carl's attention.
A storm is brewing in the distance.
Mr. Fredricksen, there is a big storm coming.
It is starting to get scary.
We are going to get blown to bits!
We are in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen!
A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.
Carl turns on his hearing aid.
What are you doing over there?
Look!
Carl joins Russell at the window.
See?
Cumulo Nimbus.
The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the storm.
The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.
Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house is rocked in the storm.
Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.
My pack!
Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.
Got ya!
The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR.
Russell screams.
He is about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut.
The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.
He chases after it.
Ellie's chair slides across the room.
Carl gasps and runs to protect it.
The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.
Carl lunges to catch it.
The storm rages.
The house is tossed into the storm clouds.
All goes black.
Carl is asleep.
A finger pokes Carl's face.
Nothing.
The finger pokes Carl's face again.
Carl WAKES UP.
Whew!
I thought you were dead.
Wha...
what happened?
Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he would been protecting.
I steered us.
I did!
I steered the house!
Steered us?
After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here.
Carl opens the window and looks out.
Huh?
The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds.
Cannot tell where we are.
Oh we are in South America all right.
It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.
Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.
GP-what?
My dad gave it to me.
It shows exactly where we are on the planet.
With this baby, we will never be lost!
Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.
Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the clouds.
Oops.
Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings.
We will get you down, find a bus stop.
You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother.
Sure, but I do not think they have busses in Paradise Falls.
A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house.
There.
That ought to do it.
Here, I will give you some change for bus fare.
Russell follows Carl toward the front door.
Nah, I will just use my city bus pass.
The house lowers into the fog.
Whoah, that is going to be like a billion transfers to get back to my house.
Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into and through the thick, dark clouds.
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
Well, we are up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.
Something flashes by them in the fog.
Carl leans forward.
...that thing was...building or something.
Another dark object whooshes past them.
Carl ducks.
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
We cannot be close to the ground yet.
A brief view of rocks directly below them.
Carl GASPS.
BAM!!!
The house CRASHES into the ground.
Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.
They land hard.
Carl's house is floating away!
Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.
Wait, wait!
No do not, do not, do not!
Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.
Whoah!
Hey, hey!
Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground.
Russell, hang on!
Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.
Whoah!
They slide toward the edge... and stop.
The drop is thousands of feet.
Carl is TERRIFIED.
Walk back!
Walk back!
Okay!
Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks.
Where... where are we?
This does not look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.
Do not worry, Ellie.
I got it.
The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand.
Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
Carl stares.
He cannot believe it.
There it is.
Ellie, it is so beautiful.
The landscape is stunning.
Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of the house atop the falls.
We made it.
We made it!
Russell, we could float right over there.
Climb up.
Climb up!
You mean assist you?
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
Okay, I will climb up!
Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.
Watch it.
Sorry.
The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.
Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up!
Got it?!
Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.
You on the porch yet?!
Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.
What?
That is it?!
I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile?
Aw, great!
Carl paces.
Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?
What are you talking about?
We could walk your house to the falls!
Walk it?
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.
Carl considers this.
The house floats against the sky.
The hose descends from the house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell.
They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.
Now, we are going to walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing.
Russell inspects his surroundings.
Uh-huh.
We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons.
And if we are not at the falls when that happens...
Sand! ...
we are not getting to the falls!
I found sand!
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.
He looks up at the house.
Do not you worry, Ellie.
We will get our house over there.
Russell looks up at the house.
Who is Carl talking to?
Huh.
This is fun already, is not it?
By the time we get there, you are going to feel so assisted...
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call.
Caw caw, raaar!!
The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.
Wait.
Why are we going to Paradise Falls again?
Hey, let us play a game.
It is called: "See who can be quiet the longest."
Cool!
My mom loves that game!
They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.
Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.
Each has a light.
Hunters.
The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another.
A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.
The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.
They surround the prey.
Escape looks impossible.
WOOSH!
The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash.
The dogs head off in pursuit.
A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain.
They whimper and run off.
Carl steps out from behind a shrub.
The SQUEALING is in fact his HEARING AID.
Darn thing.
C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?
Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.
I am tiiiired.
And my knee hurts.
Which knee?
My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
I asked you about that five minutes ago!
Well, I did not have to go then!
Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.
I do not want to walk anymore.
Can we stop?
Russell!
If you do not hurry up, the tigers will eat you.
There is no tigers in South America.
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.
Zoology.
Oh, for the love of Pete.
Go on into the bushes and do your business.
Okay!
Here, hold my stuff.
Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands, secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.
He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another.
I have always wanted to try this!
Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.
Mr. Fredricksen?
Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after?
Eugh!
None of my concern!
Beat.
Oh.
It is before!
Carl covers his ears.
Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.
He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.
Huh?
Tracks?!
Snipe!
Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.
Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
Snipe!
The footprints continue for a time, then stop.
Huh.
Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.
He turns to look.
Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out.
Russell turns.
Nothing there.
Another nibble!
Zip!
Ha!
Gotcha!
Russell peers into the shrub.
Do not be afraid, little snipe.
I am a Wilderness Explorer
so I am a friend to all of nature.
Want some more?
Russell holds out the chocolate.
The beak pokes out and nibbles.
Hi boy.
Do not eat it all.
Come on out.
The beak zips back into the bushes.
Come on.
Do not be afraid little snipe.
Nice snipe.
Good little snipe.
Nice...
A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.
...
giant snipe!
Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.
Russell and the massive creature step up behind him.
I found the snipe!
Oh, did you?
Are they tall?
Oh yes, they are very tall.
Do they have a lot of colors?
They do indeed.
Do they like chocolate?
Oh ye-
Chocolate?
Carl turns to look.
Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.
Carl SCREAMS.
What is that thing?!
It is a snipe!
There is no such thing as a snipe!
But you said snipes eat-- Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.
The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.
It cradles Russell like a baby.
Whoah!
Russell GIGGLES.
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.
Go on, get out of here.
Go on!
Shoo!
The bird HISSES.
It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully.
It looks scary and fun.
Whoah!
Whoah!
Careful, Russell!
Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me!
Russell!
The bird grooms Russell.
No stop, that tickles!
Carl pokes the bird with his cane.
Get out of here.
Go on, git!
The bird sets Russell down.
It stalks Carl, HISSING and ruffling its feathers.
Aaaah!
Uh-oh!
No no
no
no no Kevin, it is okay.
Mr. Fredricksen is nice!
Russell pats Carl on the head.
"Kevin"?
Yeah, that is his name I just gave him.
The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.
Hey.
Beat it!
Vamoose!
Scram!
Carl waves his cane.
The bird eats it.
Hey!
That is mine!
The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.
Aaah!
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here.
Carl shoos the bird away.
The bird mimics him.
Go on, beat it.
GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.
The bird mimics this as well.
Can we keep him?
Please??
I will get the food for him, I will walk him, I will change his newspapers...
"An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole."
That does not even rhyme.
Yeah it does.
Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.
Hey, look!
Kevin!
What?
Get down!
You are not allowed up there!
The bird is on Carl's roof.
It swallows a balloon.
It POPS.
The bird coughs up the deflated balloon.
Russell GIGGLES.
You come down here right now!
The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.
Sheesh!
Can you believe this, Ellie?
Ellie?
Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the bird?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
She said for you to let me.
But I told him no --
I told you no!
N-O.
The bird HISSES at Carl.
Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.
Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.
The bird follows, eating.
I see you back there!
It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.
Go on, get out of here.
Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.
Hey, are you okay over there?
The bird dashes away.
Uh, hello?
Carl and Russell look around.
In the midst, some 100 feet away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.
Oh!
Hello sir!
Thank goodness.
Carl walks toward the man.
It is nice to know someone else is up here!
I can smell you.
Carl stops.
What?
You can smell us?
I can smell you.
As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.
Hey.
Russell GIGGLES.
You were talking to a rock.
Russell points to another rock shape.
Hey, that one looks like a turtle!
Sure enough.
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog!
The "rock" walks forward.
It is a dog!
What?
Uh, we are not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.
The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.
Hey, I like dogs!
We have your dog!
Wonder who he belongs to?
Sit boy.
The dog sits.
Hey look, he is trained!
Shake!
The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.
Uh-huh.
Speak.
Hi there.
Carl and Russell freeze.
Did that dog just say "Hi there?"
Oh yes.
Carl JUMPS back.
My name is Dug.
I have just met you
and I love you.
Dug jumps up on to Carl.
Uh..wha?
Dug wears a high-tech collar.
The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker.
It can talk.
Unfortunately, it talks non-stop.
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!!
Dug stares transfixed at a tree.
False alarm.
My master is good and smart.
It is not possible.
Oh it is, because my master is smart.
Cool!
What do these do, boy?
He inspects the collar and twists a dial.
Hey would you- -cuerdo con tigo-
I use that collar- -watashi
wa hanashi ma-
-to talk with, I would be happy if you stopped.
Russell, do not touch that.
It could be radioactive or something.
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.
I am a great tracker.
My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself.
Have you seen a bird?
I want to find one and I have been on the scent.
I am a great tracker, did I mention that?
BAM!
The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.
Hey, that is the bird!
I have never seen one up close but this is the bird.
May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?
Yes!
Take it!
And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!
Oh I can bark!
Dug BARKS.
And here is howling!
Dug HOWLS.
The bird HISSES at Dug.
Can we keep him?
Please please please?
Russell falls to his knees, pleading.
But it is a talking dog!
It is just a weird trick or something.
Let us get to the falls.
Carl grabs Russell.
The bird follows, as does Dug.
Please be my prisoner.
Oh please oh please be my prisoner.
Footprints.
A dog's nose follows the tracks.
This is GAMMA, a bulldog.
Oh, here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!
A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?
Chocolate.
I smell chocolate.
I am getting prunes and denture cream!
Who are they?
Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
We would better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha?
ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.
No.
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.
Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he is breathed in helium.
Find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage.
Beta and Gamma look at each other.
Hey Alpha, I think there is something wrong with your collar.
You must have bumped it.
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
Beta and Gamma LAUGH.
Alpha turns.
They stop laughing.
Beta.
Gamma.
Mayhaps you desire to -- SQUIRREL!
All three dogs look for the squirrel.
False alarm.
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning?
No no.
But maybe Dug would.
You might want to ask him.
Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.
Yeah, I wonder if he is found the bird on his very special mission.
Do not mention Dug to me at this time.
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed.
Ha ha ha.
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?
Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.
You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant.
Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.
The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's collar.
Hi Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now.
Yeah, right.
The screen view adjusts to see the bird.
It hisses.
Impossible!
Where are you?!
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back
and then you will like me.
Oh, got to go.
On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face.
It is Russell.
Hey Dug!
Who you talking to?
The video screen goes blank.
The dogs BARK excitedly.
What is Dug doing?
Why is he with that small mailman?
Where are they?
Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.
A TRACKING DEVICE locates Dug.
There he is.
Come on!
The dogs sprint off into the jungle.
The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it is leg.
Oh please
oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner!
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
That man there says I can take the bird
and I love that man there like he is my master.
The bird HISSES.
I am not your master!
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.
Dug jumps up on it.
I am warning you, once again, bird!
Hey!
Quit it!
I am jumping on you now, bird.
Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.
Russell!
At this rate we will never get to the falls!
Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.
Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock.
SMASH!
Carl GASPS.
He turns his anger to the group.
I am nobody's master, got it?
I do not want you here, ...and I do not want you here.
I am stuck with you.
And if you two do not clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.
A ball!
Oh boy oh boy!
A ball!
Ball?
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
You want it boy?
Huh?
Huh?
Yeah?
Oh oh oh!
Yes, I do.
I do ever so want the ball!
Go get it!!
Carl throws the ball far away.
Dug chases after it.
Oh boy, oh boy!
I will get it and then bring it back!
Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.
Why?
Just give it to me!
Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.
Bird.
Bird!
Carl THROWS the chocolate.
The bird runs after it.
Carl grabs Russell and runs.
C'mon Russell!
Wait.
Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.
Carl pulls them down a slope.
He slips.
Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.
Daah!
Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.
Carl slips and his foot goes into the water.
Aaahh...
What are we doing?
Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.
BUGS buzz around him.
Carl climbs up the hill.
He FALLS over a dead branch.
Hey, uh, we are pretty far now.
Kevin's going to miss me.
They climb over a ridge.
Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.
Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.
I think that did the trick.
He turns.
Dug.
With the ball in his mouth.
Hi, Master.
Afternoon.
Carl turns the other way.
The bird.
It HONKS at him.
Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.
A clap of thunder.
Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house.
Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.
Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.
He rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.
Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie.
Which one's the front?
Russell struggles to set up the tent.
He reads his manual.
Is this step three, or step five?
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.
There!
Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place.
Carl cannot watch.
An off screen SMACK!
Russell walks to Carl.
Miraculously, he looks unscathed.
All done.
Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.
That is for you!
The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the cliff.
Awh.
Tents are hard.
Wait, are not you "Super Wilderness Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?
Yeah,
but... can I tell you a secret?
Alright, here goes.
I never actually built a tent before.
There.
I said it.
You have been camping before, have not you?
Well, never outside.
Well, why did not you ask your Dad how to build a tent?
I do not think he wants to talk about this stuff.
Why do not you try him sometime?
Maybe he will surprise you.
Well, he is away a lot.
I do not see him much.
He is got to be home sometime.
Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis?
You call your own mother by her first name?
Phyllis is not my mom.
Carl realizes he put his foot in it.
The two sit silently together, watching the fire.
But he promised he would come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right?
Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.
He looks at the missing badge on Russell's sash.
Hey, uh, why do not you get some sleep.
Do not want to wake up the traveling flea circus.
Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner.
We have to protect him!
Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.
Can Kevin go with us?
Alright.
He can come.
Promise you will not leave him?
Yeah.
Cross your heart?
Carl looks down at Russell.
Cross my heart.
Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.
He shakes his head and looks up at the house.
What have I got myself into, Ellie?
A frog sits next to Carl's glasses.
It CROAKS.
Carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock.
The frog hops away.
Carl rises, looking up at the house.
Morning Sweetheart.
The balloons on the house are wilting.
We better get moving.
He scans the camp.
The bird is gone.
Huh.
Bird's gone.
Maybe Russell will not notice.
Alright, everybody up!
Russell sits up with a SNORT.
Where is Kevin?
He is wandered off!
Kevin!
Dug, find Kevin!
Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.
Find the bird.
Find the bird...
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.
Oh, look!
There he is.
Russell points to the right.
The bird is on top of Carl's house.
Dug turns around.
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.
Hey, that is my food!
Get off my roof!
Yeah, get off of his <>!
In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.
The bird CALLS back.
What is it doing?
The bird is calling to her babies.
Her babies!
Kevin's a girl?
The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.
Her house is over there in those twisty rocks.
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.
The baby birds call from somewhere inside.
She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.
The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head with her beak.
She HISSES at Dug.
Wait, Kevin's just leaving?
But you promised to protect her!
Her babies need her, we got to make sure they are together.
The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.
Carl gathers up the hose tether.
Sorry Russell.
We have lost enough time already.
Yeah...
The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead.
She scampers back toward the house.
Russell chews on some chocolate.
This was her favorite chocolate.
Because you sent her away, there is more for you.
Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.
They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.
Huh?
Kevin?
Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling.
Carl protects Russell with his cane.
Dug is conflicted.
Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.
He turns toward Dug.
Where is the bird?
You said you had the bird.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that.
Where is it?
Uh, tomorrow.
Come back tomorrow
and then I will again have the bird.
Yes.
Alpha BARKS angrily.
You lost it.
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?
Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes.
Carl and Russell look at Dug.
He turned on them!
Dug shamefully lowers his head.
Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions.
Come!
Wait, we are not going with you.
We are going to the falls!
Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.
Get away from me!
Get down!
The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.
Dug follows.
The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.
Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.
Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.
Four more large dogs join the group.
Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march.
They round a bend.
Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.
The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening.
DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave.
Carl and Russell stop.
More dogs approach from the side.
Every way Carl turns there are more dogs!
Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.
Closer... closer...
From the darkness a voice: Stay!
The dogs stop.
A figure peers out from the darkness.
It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.
You came here in that?
Uh...
yeah.
In a house?
A floating house?
The man laughs.
Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.
That is the darndest thing I have ever seen!
You are not after my bird, are you?
But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I would be happy to oblige!
The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
My dogs made a mistake.
The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.
Carl recognizes him!
Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!
Well...
Yes.
The Charles Muntz?
Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."
"Adventure is out there!"
Carl GIGGLES with glee.
It is really him!
That is Charles Muntz!
It is?!?
Who is Charles Muntz?
Him!
Yes!
It is him!
He is!
I am Carl Fredricksen.
My wife and I, we were your biggest fans!
Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.
Muntz is charmed.
Well, you are a man of good taste!
Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.
Carl joins in.
You must be tired.
Hungry?
Uh-huh.
Attention everyone!
These people are no longer intruders.
They are our guests.
The dogs CHEER.
Follow me!
I like you temporarily.
You do smell like prunes.
I will not bite you.
Muntz walks into the cave.
Carl and Russell excitedly follow.
Wow.
Carl's eyes adjust to the dark.
Muntz's dirigible the "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.
I am sorry about the dogs -- hope they were not too rough on you.
We were not!
Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine.
Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.
Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.
We are not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?!
Oh.
Would you like to?
Would I?!?!
Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!
Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.
Jiminy Cricket.
Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.
Not you.
What do we do with Dug?
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.
Dug WHIMPERS.
Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.
Dug sits forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.
I do not like the Cone of Shame.
Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.
It is a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures, and rare cultural artifacts.
Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and Russell through the room.
Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Munich, London...
`Course I kept the best for myself.
Did you ever!
Will you look at that?
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium.
Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth.
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.
A dog approaches carrying a menu.
Muntz waves it off.
Oh, surprise me.
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as "dental equipment!"
Muntz LAUGHS.
Behind him, a dog cannot resist gnawing at one of the bones.
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise!
Oh, you recognize it?
I am impressed!
That is an interesting story there...
A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.
Muntz glances at the bottle.
Hm, excellent choice.
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
POP!
They sloppily pour two glasses.
He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings.
And did he cheat?
Oh, he was horrible!
Muntz and Carl LAUGH.
Alpha interrupts.
Master, dinner is ready.
Oh dear, broken translator.
It is that loose wire again.
There you go big fella.
Thank you Master.
Russell reacts.
I liked his other voice.
Muntz LAUGHS.
Well, dinner is served!
Right this way.
Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table.
So how are things stateside?
Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here...
Please.
Dogs pull back chairs for them.
They sit.
Dog waiters place napkins on their laps.
I hope you are hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I have ever had.
Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time.
The meals look delicious.
Oh, Epsilon, you have done it again!
Yes!!
Russell is served a hot dog.
His waiter cannot resist and eats a bite.
Hey!
Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass.
Hey!
Carl looks around, still enthralled.
Oh my Ellie would have loved all this.
You know, it is because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls.
He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole window.
I am honored.
And now you have made it!
You are sure we are not a bother?
I would hate to impose.
No no!
It is a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat.
The dogs erupt into excited barking.
Treat?!
Treat!
I want a treat!
No no, quiet!
Calm down.
Calm down...
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.
Hey! Should not have used that word...
Having guests is a delight.
More often I get thieves, come to steal what is rightfully mine.
Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.
They called me a fraud, those... dah!
But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.
The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers.
Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD.
Kevin.
This is Muntz's obsession.
He looks over to a full size skeleton.
Beautiful, is not it?
I have spent a lifetime tracking it.
Sometimes years go by between sightings...
I have tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Cannot go in after it.
Once in, there is no way out.
Lost so many dogs...
Muntz is lost in reverie.
And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take!
But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place.
Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.
Hey, that looks like Kevin!
"Kevin?"
Yeah!
That is my new giant bird pet.
I trained it to follow us.
Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.
Follow you?
Impossible.
How?
She likes chocolate.
Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.
Chocolate?
Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes ga-ga for it.
Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.
But it ran off!
It is gone now.
Muntz stares.
He walks to a table full of flight helmets.
You know, Carl.
These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories.
A "Surveyor" making a map.
Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.
It rolls across the floor.
A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.
Muntz topples another helmet.
He lifts a third to show Carl.
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
He drops the helmet.
It rolls to Carl's feet.
That is the best one yet.
I cannot wait to hear how it ends.
Carl glances around nervously.
Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE Well!
It is been a wonderful evening, but we would better be going.
Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.
Oh, you are not leaving?
We do not want to take advantage of your hospitality.
Come on Russell.
Carl leads Russell toward the door.
But we have not even had dessert yet.
Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.
No, the boy's right.
You have not had dessert.
Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee.
Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream.
Oh, you really must stay.
I insist!
We have so much more to talk about!
A distant HAUNTED WAIL.
Everyone stops.
Kevin?
Muntz walks to the window and looks out.
Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
It is here.
He turns back to Carl... but they are gone.
Get them!
Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.
Hurry!
I am hurrying!
Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.
They are coming!
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
Dogs block the cave opening.
Carl stops short.
Master, over here!
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.
Carl and Russell run toward him.
The cave leads to a steep incline.
The dogs are getting closer.
There is no choice but to JUMP.
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts.
Go toward the light, master!
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.
The bird sees the dogs.
She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back.
She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.
BANG BANG BANG!
Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling.
The house lowers.
Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path.
Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground.
Russell!
Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.
The dogs close in on Russell.
Alpha bites at his heels.
Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.
Get back!!
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down!
The dogs stop short.
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.
Dug is up on the canyon wall.
He caused the avalanche!
Go on Master!
I will stop the dogs!
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.
Stop you dogs!!
The dogs run around Dug.
Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.
The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.
She rounds a corner.
Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.
The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.
Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air.
Help!
Help!
Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
Give Me your hand!
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird.
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.
A river winds 100 feet below.
Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.
Hang on to Kevin!
Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.
Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm.
Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below.
Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.
The dogs are stuck on the other side.
Carl painfully gets up.
He looks up at his house.
It is still intact.
He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
Kevin!
The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground.
Russell rushes to her side.
The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.
She cannot stand.
Russell applies a bandage.
From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
Kevin CALLS back to them.
She tries to stand, but cannot.
Russell runs to her side.
No no no!
Kevin!
Stay down.
She is hurt real bad.
Cannot we help her get home?
Carl looks at the bird's wounds.
He looks to the rock maze, then to his house.
He knows the right thing to do.
And he hates himself for it.
Alright.
But we have got to hurry.
Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.
You lost them?
Uh, it was Dug.
Yeah, he is with them.
He helped them escape!
Muntz snarls in anger.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Dug...
He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.
DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on Dug's location.
Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.
Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.
See anything?
No, my pack is not following us!
Boy they are dumb.
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy.
This is crazy.
I finally meet my childhood hero and he is trying to kill us!
What a joke.
Hey, I know a joke.
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead.
Ha!
It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.
Careful Russell.
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch.
You okay, Kevin?
Kevin goes back to sleep.
Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
The wilderness is not quite what I expected.
Yeah?
How so?
It is kind of... wild.
I mean, it is not how they made it sound in my book.
Hmm, get used to that, kid.
My dad made it sound so easy.
He is really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff.
He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings.
Russell smiles at the thought.
And afterwards we would go get ice cream at Fentons.
I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle.
Then we would sit on this one curb, right outside, and I will count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins.
I like that curb.
He looks up at Carl.
That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.
They walk in silence.
Carl understands.
The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.
Kevin CALLS BACK.
Look, there it is!
Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.
He tries to run but is pulled back by his tether.
LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.
Hold on Russell, stand still!
Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance.
Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.
She runs off ahead.
Carl and Russell LAUGH.
Look at that bird go!
Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
That is it, go Kevin!
Go find your babies!
Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them.
MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.
Run Kevin!
Run!
A net shoots out and binds her.
She falls and CALLS OUT.
Oh no!
The net catches on a rock.
Carl and Russell run to her aid.
Russell, give me your knife!
Carl saws frantically at the net.
Get away from my bird!
Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.
Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.
Muntz hurls a lit lantern.
Flames burst up beneath the house.
Heat waves ripple up.
Balloons POP.
Carl's house LOWERS into the fire.
Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.
Carl panics.
He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
Muntz motions to the dogs.
They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net.
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible.
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.
Careful.
We want her in good shape for my return.
Let her go!
Stop!
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
The dirigible flies off.
Kevin!
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.
He extinguishes the flames.
Carl collapses on the side of his house.
You gave away Kevin.
You just gave her away.
This is none of my concern.
I did not ask for any of this!
Master.
It is alright.
I am not your master!
And if you had not a shown up, none of this would have happened!
Bad dog!
Bad dog!
Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
Carl angrily puts on the harness.
Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me.
He walks off.
Russell falls in behind.
An angry dawn breaks.
Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape.
Russell's harness drags along side, empty.
Russell walks behind.
With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
The house groans as it comes to rest.
Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.
He looks over.
He is finally made it: Paradise Falls.
Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.
Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.
Next to him stands the real house, just like Ellie wanted.
Here.
Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.
I do not want this anymore.
Russell walks away.
He sits on a rock, alone.
Carl picks up the sash.
He walks up the steps of his house.
The door opens.
Carl steps in.
He is back in his house for the first time in days.
Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey.
Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position.
He pushes their two chairs back into their place.
Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.
Quiet.
Nothing, savedag the distant sound of the falls outside.
Carl surveys the room.
The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.
He opens it and puts Ellie's drawing back.
He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
He turns to the page marked:
STUFF I AM GOING TO DO.
Carl sighs.
He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it.
He closes the book.
But as he does, Carl sees something he had not before.
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
On a picnic.
Celebrating birthdays.
Another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
Carl's face warms.
Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life.
A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs.
Beneath it, Ellie has written: Carl smiles.
He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.
On the arm is Russell's sash.
Carl picks it up.
He looks to Ellie's chair.
He crosses his heart.
Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.
Russell?
But Russell is nowhere to be seen.
A shadow crosses Carl.
He looks up to see Russell floating off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.
Russell!
I am going to help Kevin even if you will not!
Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into the sky.
No, Russell!
No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it.
He struggles, but the house does not budge.
The balloons have lost too much helium.
Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.
It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud.
This gives him an idea.
The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground.
Chairs, dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.
Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.
Then another.
Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.
It teeters... and falls.
The house lifts off!
Wahhoo!
The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things.
Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls.
The house soars into the air, sails billowing.
Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
Carl's eyes go wide.
Russell?
The door swings open.
Dug!
I was hiding under your porch because I love you.
Can I stay?
Can you stay?
Well, you are my dog are not you?
And I am your master!
You are my master?!
Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.
Oh boy.
Oh boy!
The house flies off into the sky.
Good boy, Dug.
You are a good boy!
Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE.
Dogs play poker.
Behind them, Russell flies past with the leaf blower.
They turn to look.
Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.
He smashes into the wall.
Ooph!
He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.
Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower, ready for action.
Yes!
Do not worry Kevin!
I will savedag - Growling dogs move toward him.
Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.
Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.
She is miserable and scared.
And they would not believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.
Alpha enters.
Master!
The small mailman has returned.
What?
Dogs tie Russell to a chair.
Let me go!
Muntz enters.
Where is your elderly friend?
Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.
He is not my friend anymore.
Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out.
Well, if you are here, Fredricksen cannot be far behind.
Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room.
Where are you keeping Kevin!?
Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel.
Let me go!
Scream all you want, small mailman.
None of your mailman friends can hear you.
I will unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training!
Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the porthole.
Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!
Alpha!
Fredricksen's coming back.
Guard that bird.
If you see the old man, you know what to do.
Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.
Hey, where are you going?
I am not finished with you!
Nice talking with you.
Muntz slams the door.
Light emerges from the floor.
Russell is on the ramp, which is opening.
Russell REACTS.
Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel.
Where are you, Fredricksen?
The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up behind.
Carl steers toward the cockpit.
He dons Russell's sash, then hooks his cane onto his back.
He is fighting for a because.
He hears SCREAMING.
It is Russell!
Tied to his chair, he slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the edge.
Russell!
Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing.
Using his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him just as Russell slides off the ramp edge.
They land safely together.
Mr. Fredricksen!
Dug!
Bring `er over!
Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp.
Carl carries Russell into the house.
Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall.
You came back for Kevin!
Let us go get her.
I am getting Kevin.
You stay here!
But I want to help!
I do not want your help.
I want you safe!
Carl leaps back into the dirigible.
Dug follows.
Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds.
Carl and Dug sneak down a hall.
They see dogs ahead and hide.
How do we get past these dogs?
Dug points to a grate in the wall.
Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the dirigible.
They sneak past two biplanes.
They emerge through a grate near the ceiling.
They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage.
Kevin!
The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT.
Do not worry Kevin, we are on our way!
Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs.
Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.
Allow no one to be entering through these doors.
Guard well that bird, my minions.
What do we do now, Dug?
Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl's cane.
Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.
He bangs his cane.
All the dogs turn.
He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.
Who wants the ball?
Me!
I do!
I want the ball!
Then go get it!
Carl throws the ball.
The dogs scramble after it.
The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.
I am going to get there first!
Oh going to get the ball!
I am going to get it!
Gamma catches it..
I got it!!
Behind them Carl shuts the door.
The dogs realize their mistake.
Uh-oh.
Carl opens the cage door.
I am sorry Kevin.
Let us get you out of here.
Muntz scans the horizon.
Suddenly the in-ship communicator comes to life.
Master!
He is gone!
The old man!
He is here!
He is got the bird!
The bird's gone!
What?
Calm down!
One at a time!
Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.
I want to help!
He manages to get his arms free.
Ha ha!
Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off.
Russell SCREAMS as he falls.
The hose unspools.
Russell reaches the end of the hose.
Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.
The house drifts away from the dirigible.
The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.
He is in Hall D!
He is in Hall B!
It is the old man!
Does anyone know where they are?!?!
On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.
Muntz stares, slack-jawed.
Whoooaaah!
The house floats off.
Grey leader!
Take down the house!
Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.
What is that noise?
From beneath the dirigible emerges...
From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge.
As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS.
Grey leader, checking in.
Grey 2, checking in.
Grey 3, checking in.
The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house.
Target sighted.
The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy that fires poison darts.
The biplanes fire and strafe Carl's house with darts.
Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose.
Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.
Come on, Kevin.
Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.
He grabs a sword from the wall display and attacks.
Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.
Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.
He slams it shut.
Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.
He hears growling and turns around.
There stands Alpha and the other dogs.
Dug runs.
The dogs give chase.
Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.
Carl uses his cane to defend himself.
Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head.
The tennis balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.
Muntz pulls the sword free.
He raises the sword over his head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly.
He is stuck!
Carl raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.
Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move.
Muntz CRACKS his back free and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.
He has the upper hand now.
He throttles him with his arm and lifts his sword.
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out!
Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.
He falls backwards.
Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin.
Come on!
Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.
Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything that gets in his way.
Enough!
I am taking that bird back with me alive or dead!
Carl trips and falls to the floor.
Muntz is about to deal the final blow.
Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.
He bumps a The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side.
Muntz is knocked off balance.
He slides to one side.
Trophy cases slide after him.
The dirigible tilts to the other side.
The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!
Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open.
Carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane.
He dangles out over open air.
He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging beneath it.
The ship corrects again.
Carl climbs back inside.
Muntz comes at Carl.
Come on, Kevin!
Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.
He pushes the bird along as he goes.
Muntz follows up.
Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room.
Alpha throws him again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a radar shade off the control panel.
Alpha moves in.
Dug hides behind the steering wheel.
I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug.
Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.
Dug cowers, but then notices the RADAR SHADE.
As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.
Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.
The dogs all GASP.
He wears the Cone of Shame!
What?
Do not just continue sitting!
Attack!
The bump caused his collar to go funny again.
The dogs all howl with laughter.
No!
No! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!
Listen you dog!
Sit!
Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.
All other dogs sit too.
Yes, Alpha.
Alpha?
I am not Alpha, he is- Oohhhh!
Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.
His hands are about to give out.
The biplanes head straight at Russell.
I cannot do it!
Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life, Muntz closing in.
Russell!
Huh?
Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
Russell CLIMBS!
He is more machine than boy now.
Biplanes shooting the whole way, he climbs up onto the porch.
The biplanes close in.
Russell yells to them.
Hey!
Squirrel!
All the dog pilots snap to attention.
Squirrel?
Where is the squirrel?!
The planes dive, crash into each other.
The dog pilots parachute out.
I hate squirrels.
Carl climbs.
Muntz grabs Carl's foot.
Carl defends himself with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder.
Muntz catches on to a rung of the ladder.
He watches Carl and the bird climb.
Muntz descends the ladder.
Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible.
Suddenly, a trap door opens.
Carl GASPS...
but it is Dug!
Dug!
Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.
Master!
The house bears down on them.
They run to meet it.
Russell!!
Over here!!
Let us go!
Russell steers the house toward Carl.
Mr. Fredricksen!
The house slows and lowers atop the airship.
Carl HOISTS the bird up onto the porch.
Come on, Kevin!
Carl helps Dug onto the porch.
He climbs up himself... BLAM!
Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!
A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings.
A third of them break or shoot skyward.
The house plummets, crashing onto the dirigible.
Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.
The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin still inside.
Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding house.
The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.
Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to stop it.
The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.
Russell!
Get out of there!
Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.
BLAM!
A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.
Muntz storms toward the house.
Carl holds desperately to the hose.
No! Leave them alone!
Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.
The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.
Carl holds on for his life.
Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.
Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door.
The house slides farther over the edge.
Carl struggles to hold on.
The hose caddy is ripping free from the house!
The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it is about to go!
Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room.
Muntz KICKS the door.
Suddenly, Carl has an idea.
Russell!
Hang on to Kevin!
Do not let go of her!
Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.
He Dug and the bird huddle together.
Muntz breaks through the door.
He lifts his rifle and sights the bird...
Through the window, Carl yells out.
Kevin!
Chocolate!
Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate.
Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from his hands.
Muntz lunges after them.
The hose caddy breaks free.
Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from her side.
Muntz leaps after them.
But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.
Muntz hangs for a moment...
It is thousands of feet from the ground....
He falls.
PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose.
He PULLS himself toward the edge.
The hose curves beneath the tail fin.
Finally it swings out...
That was cool!
Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.
The bird holds on to the hose with her beak.
Carl LAUGHS, relieved.
Do not jerk around so much, kid!
Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.
Oh I am ready to not be up high.
Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
Carl looks into the distance.
His house, now empty, floats softly down into the clouds, and disappears.
Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen.
Carl smiles.
He puts his arm around Russell.
You know, it is just a house.
Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds.
Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.
The babies peck at Carl's head.
Carl and Russell LAUGH.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Look at you.
You are so soft.
Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the LABYRINTH.
Time to go.
Awwww!
I wish I could keep one.
The babies run to the bird.
One stops to HISS at Dug.
Carl has misplaced something.
Huh, where is my cane?
I just had it here...
Kevin starts HACKING.
She COUGHS up the cane.
Babies start HACKING too.
They COUGH up tennis balls.
You know what?
Keep `them.
A little gift from me to you.
The bird family enters the labyrinth.
Carl and Russell wave.
Bye Kevin!
The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist.
Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets and goggles.
Ready?
Carl gives a thumbs up.
Ready!
Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky.
Dug and all of MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows, barking as they fly into the sunset.
...and by receiving their badges, the following Explorers will graduate to Senior Explorers.
Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father.
As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the father a badge, who pins it to his son's sash.
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore... Congratulations, Jimmy.
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts... Congratulations, Brandon.
For Assisting the Elderly...
Russell is tanned and dirty.
And alone.
Uh, Russell?
Is there... someone that...
uh...
The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.
Russell looks for his dad in the audience.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Old man coming through.
Carl takes his place next to Russell.
I am here for him.
Congratulations, Russell.
Sir...
The Camp Master hands Carl the badge and continues down the line.
Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge.
Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.
