sunny morning man sat breakfast nook looked scrambled eggs white unicorn golden horn quietly cropping roses garden
man went bedroom wife asleep
unicorn garden said
Eating roses
opened unfriendly eye
unicorn mythical beast said
man walked slowly downstairs
browsing tulips
unicorn said man * pulled lily
unicorn ate gravely
unicorn garden man went upstairs * roused wife
unicorn said ate lily
wife sat bed * looked coldly
booby said * going booby hatch
man liked words * liked unicorn garden thought moment
*
walked door
golden horn middle forehead told
went garden watch unicorn * unicorn gone away
man sat roses
husband gone house wife got
gloat eye
telephoned police * telephoned psychiatrist * told hurry house * bring strait jacket
psychiatrist arrived sat chairs * looked great interest
husband said saw unicorn
police looked psychiatrist * psychiatrist looked police
told ate lily said
psychiatrist looked police * police looked psychiatrist
told golden horn middle forehead said
solemn signal psychiatrist police leaped chairs * seized wife
hard time subduing * terrific struggle * finally subdued
got straight jacket husband came house
tell wife saw unicorn asked police

took away cursing * shut institution
husband lived happily
Moral count boobies
