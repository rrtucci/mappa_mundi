The upbeat show tune Put On Your Sunday Clothes plays
Out there there is world outside of Yonkers
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Moving towards it
Pushing through its polluted atmosphere
Close your eyes and see it glisten
range of mountains takes form in the haze
[%@!]
The mountains are piles of Trash
The entire surface is nothing but waste
We are going to find adventure in the evening air
[%@!]
What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash
Thousands of neatly stacked Cubes Of Trash stories high
Rows of stacked cubes like city avenues [%@!] rows of stacked cubes like city avenues
They go on for miles
Beneath your parasol the world is all smile
Something moving on the ground far below
[%@!]
Small Service Robot diligently cubing trash
[%@!]
[%@!]
Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting
Mini shovel hands collect junk
Scoop it into his open chassis
His front plate closes slowly compressing waste
faded label on his corroded chest plate Waste Allocation Loader Earth Class Wall spits out cube of trash
Stacks it with the others
Something catches his eye
Tugs on piece of metal stuck in the stack
[%@!]
The sun reflects off it
Wall checks the sky
The sun sets through the smoggy haze
And we will not come back until we have kissed girl He places the hubcap in his compactor
Presses button on his chest
The song stops playing
[%@!]
Wall attaches lunch cooler to his back
[%@!]
The insect hops on his shoulder
They motor down from the top of Giant Trash Tower
Wall travels alone
Traverses miles of desolate waste
Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash
[%@!]
Everything branded with the Same Company Logo
Buy Large Bnl stores restaurants banks transportation
The corporation ran every aspect of life
There is even Bnl Logo on Wall chest plate
Close On Newspaper Wall drives over
[%@!]
Earth Covered
The deck Bnl Ceo Declares Global Emergency
photo of the Bnl Ceo giving weak smile
Wall old treads are threadbare
[%@!]
[%@!]
He passes the remains of other Rusted Wall Units
[%@!]
Wall now sports the newer treads
[%@!]
The solar powered ads still activate when he passes them
[%@!]
There is plenty of space out in space
Ad starliners take off from Earth Bnl starliners leaving each day
Ad Wall units wave goodbye
We will clean up the mess while you are away
Wall drives down deserted overpass
Activates an even Larger Holographic Billboard
Shows off City Sized Luxury Starliner
Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities
[%@!]
Spend your five year cruise in style
Waited on 24 hours day by our fully automated crew while your Captain chart course for non stop entertainment fine dining [%@!] Waited on 24 hours day by our fully automated crew while your Autopilot chart course for non stop entertainment fine dining
And with our all access hover chairs even Grandma can join the fun
There is no need to walk
[%@!]
Putting the star in Executive Starliner
The Bnl Ceo appears at the end
Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off
Because at Bnl space is the final fun tier
The holographic billboard powers off
Reveals the Axiom Deserted Launchpad in the distance
The mammoth structure sits across the bay
[%@!]
[%@!]
Near its edge rests Wall Unit Transport Truck
giant child Tonka Truck left to weather the elements
Buy Large logo on its side
Wall approaches the rear of the truck
Pulls on lever
[%@!]
[%@!]
Open racks for storing Wall Es line both walls
Knickknacks Of Found Junk littered everywhere
The tired robot removes his newfound treads
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Jury rigged to an ipod
Pushes in cassette labeled Hello Dolly
The image is very poor quality
Actors sing to Put On Your Sunday Clothes [%@!] Actors dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes
The same song Wall worked to
Wall opens his cooler
[%@!]
Pulls out the hubcap from his chest
Looks back at the Tv
[%@!]
Pretends the hubcap is hat
Continues to unpack spark
[%@!]
[%@!]
He presses Button by the rack of shelves
They rotate until an empty space appears
His new items are lovingly added to the shelf
The Zippo joins pre existing Lighter Collection
new song It Only Takes Moment plays on the video
Wall is drawn to it
Presses his Record button
Two lovers sing gently to one another
They kiss hold hands
Wall tilts his head as he watches
[%@!]
Holds his own hands
[%@!]
Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out
Pauses to take in the night sky
Stars struggle to be seen through the polluted haze
Wall presses the Play button on his chest
The newly sampled It Only Takes Moment plays
The wind picks up
Warning Light sounds on Wall chest
He looks out into the night
Raging Sandstorm approaches off the bay
[%@!]
Iotam still gently playing
[%@!]
The massive wave of sand roars closer Wall raises the door
[%@!]
Whistles for his cockroach to come inside
The door shuts just as the storm hits
Obliterates everything in view
[%@!]
[%@!]
Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in
It happily dives in
Wall collapses himself into storable cube
[%@!]
shuts down for the night
Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell
[%@!]
He wakes
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall fully exposed in its light
His front panel splayed out like tanning shield
[%@!]
His Charge Meter chimes full
Solar panels fold away into hiding
Wall now awake collects his lunch cooler
Heads off to work
and accidentally runs over the cockroach
[%@!]
Reveals the Flattened Insect under his tread
The cockroach simply pops back to life
[%@!]
[%@!]
Relieved Wall resumes their commute
Cu of Wall hands digging into garbage
Cu of trash being scooped into his chest compactor
[%@!]
Wall discovers Bra in the garbage
Unsure what it is for
Tries placing it over his eyes like glasses
Tosses it in his cooler
Wall finds set of Car Keys
Presses the remote lock
[%@!]
[%@!]
The ball keeps smacking him in the face
He does not like it
Wall discovers Diamond Ring in Jewel Case
Throws out the ring
Keeps the case
The jewel case drops into the cooler then
Wall finds Fire Extinguisher
Activates it
[%@!]
It is tossed far far away from his cooler
Wall shovel hand strikes something solid
Faces Refrigerator much larger than himself
[%@!]
Welding Beam moves down its center
It emits from between Wall Split Binocular Eyes
The door falls apart in two pieces
Reveals in its early stage of growth
Wall is entranced
Carefully he extracts the section of earth around it
Wall gently places the plant inside the old boot
Dusts dirt off the leaves
Robot return home [%@!] faithful cockroach return home
Wall stops short of the threshold
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall moves to touch it
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall drops his Igloo
[%@!]
The dot leads Wall deep into the polluted expanse
He is so fixated on it he does not notice coming from every direction
All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain
Triangulating towards center
Wall dot suddenly stops
Slowly he reaches for it
Can not grab it
[%@!]
All The Dots converge in front of him
The ground shakes
Wall becomes confused
Does not see above him
The Sun growing brighter behind the cloud cover
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall senses he should look to the sky
Now Three Suns are descending on him
Wall runs for it
An enormous Column Of Fire blocks his path
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall cubes the ground beneath him
[%@!]
Noise deafening
Heat rising
Digs in just as tide of flame carpets the ground
[%@!]
Smoke clears
Wall head rises out of the dirt
Glows red hot from the heat
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall climbs out of his hole
Bangs his head on metal
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Frightened Wall tries to hide
[%@!]
He places Small Rock on his head
[%@!]
Device lowers to the ground on long stem
[%@!]
Wall creeps closer for better look
The device unfolds
Wall boxes up again
Capsule descends from chute in the stem
Robot Arms emerge from the device
Place the capsule on the ground
[%@!]
The capsule falls away in sections to reveal
It hovers gracefully above the ground
[%@!]
Egg shaped
Blue lit eyes
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall is transfixed
[%@!]
[%@!]
Tilts his head
Time stops
She is the most beautiful thing he is ever seen
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
The device rises back into the ship
Exposes Wall He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock
Never takes his eyes off Eve
Watches her float away from the ship
[%@!]
[%@!]
Engines roar back to life
Wall digging furiously
The rocket takes off
Smoke clears
Again red hot Wall peeks out from the ground
Looks for Eve
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds
Waits until it is completely out of sight then Eve rises high up into the air
She flies around the bay
[%@!]
Does loops in the sky
[%@!]
He is hypnotized
Eve descends gently to the ground
Wall sneaks up closer
[%@!]
[%@!]
Makes Noise
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Smoke clears All quiet
[%@!]
Scans the area
[%@!]
[%@!]
Hovers away to probe more of the planet
Wall boxed up behind what little remains of the rock
[%@!]
Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
She moves on
He follows
Eve probes mound of tires
[%@!]
He flinches at the sight of innocently approaching Eve from behind
She spins around
Blasts the insect
Wall is gut punched
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater
[%@!]
[%@!]
Eve finds the insect intriguing
Lowers her arm
The end separates into individual hovering sections
She let us the insect crawl up her arm
[%@!]
It tickles
Wall relaxes
[%@!]
Eve sonically picks up Wall location
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Quick glimpses of Wall dodging the blasts
Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him
Wall now exposed
[%@!]
Boxes himself up
[%@!]
Eve holds her fire
She slowly approaches Wall box
Keeps her gun trained on him
Wall peeks out from his box
Does not understand thing she says
[%@!]
Can not believe she is real
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm
Jumps onto his master
Eve scans Wall Red Light appears on her chest
[%@!]
He is not what she is looking for
She retracts her gun arm
[%@!]
Wall watches her go
[%@!]
Eve scans through the market
Wall follows from safe distance
[%@!]
Eve glances over at him
[%@!]
[%@!]
Creates an avalanche
They chase him down flight of stairs
Wall reaches the exit doors
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall perched on the roof
Patiently watches Eve fly
She scans the ground below her like searchlight
Eve comes in for landing below
[%@!]
[%@!]
Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape
[%@!]
[%@!]
Eve does not wake
Wall creeps up to her
Opens his arms wide [%@!] measures her
Turns to pile of trash
Splits open his eyes
Begins welding something
[%@!]
Does double take
Trash Sculpture Of Eve stands in front of her
She hovers away unimpressed
Does not notice Wall hiding behind Pile Of Pipes
Wall kicks the pipes in frustration
They roll on top of him
[%@!]
[%@!]
Slams the hood shut
[%@!]
[%@!]
Slams the door shut
[%@!]
[%@!]
Slams the hatch shut
[%@!]
[%@!]
Slams the lid shut
[%@!]
[%@!]
Not finding what she is looking for
Wall eavesdrops from afar
Eve flies past the ship Crane Magnet
[%@!]
Wrestles to free herself
Furious she Blows Up The Entire Ship
The reaction startles Wall Eve slumps down against dredged anchor
She gives up
Concerned Wall cautiously approaches
Sits at the other end of the anchor
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck
[%@!]
Musters the courage to speak when She suddenly turns to him Wall falls backwards with surprise
Eve scrolls through variety of languages Directive
[%@!]
Wall eagerly turns to some nearby trash
Scoops it into his compactor
Proudly spits out cube
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
She scans his Chest Logo
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall nearly melts
She says his name so beautifully
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall tries to repeat it Eeee
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
She giggles again
Wall likes making her giggle
[%@!]
[%@!]
The wind kicks up
The Warning Light sounds on Wall chest
He moves to grab her
She draws her gun on him
Does not understand the danger
The sandstorm rushes up behind her
[%@!]
Wall collapses into box
The storm hits full force
Eve is instantly lost disoriented
Wall Wall Wall Hand appears out of the dust
Calmly takes Eve hand
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall pulls Eve inside
Closes the door
She coughs up dust
Wall hits switch
Strings of Christmas Lights fill the space
His racks of oddities painted in colored light
[%@!]
Eve is taken aback
She drifts through the sea of knickknacks
Becomes spooked by Singing Billy Bass Fish
Threatens to shoot it
He is compelled to show her everything
Hands her an eggbeater
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Curious she begins unspooling the tape
He grabs it back
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
The movie eventually appears on the Tv
Plays clip of Poysc
Wall is relieved
[%@!]
Encourages her to try
She clumsily hops up [%@!] She clumsily hops down
Makes dents in the floor
Rattles everything
Wall politely stops her
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Accidentally strikes Wall He flies into the shelves
Eve helps him up from the mess
Wall Left Binocular Eye falls off
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wall placates her
Feels his way to the rack of shelves
Rotates them until
Spare Wall Parts appear
Replaces his broken eye with new one
Eve is relieved
She eyes his Lighter Collection
Flicks open Zippo
Ignites Flame
Wall freezes
He had no idea it could do that
Moves closer to inspect it
It is the closest he is ever been to Eve
She remains focused on the lighter
Wall stares up at her
[%@!]
The tiny flame flickering between them
The Hello Dolly video plays Iotam in the background
Suddenly he is moved to express his love
Musters the courage to open his fingers
Timidly reaches his hand out to hers
Eve turns [%@!] Eve looks at him
Wall instantly chokes
Pulls his hand back
Eve becomes intrigued with the Tv
Scans the image of the lovers singing Iotam
Wall watches her
[%@!]
Then he remembers
[%@!]
He rushes to his shelves
Eve watches him rummage through junk
drum falls down on his head
She giggles charmed by it all
[%@!]
She is drawn back to the lovers on Tv then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand
[%@!]
She turns to find Wall holding something
[%@!]
Eve immediately locks onto it
[%@!]
In flash her chest opens
Tractor Beam snatches the plant away
stores it inside her
Then she shuts down completely
Only Single Green Light pulsing on her chest
Wall is stunned
What did do
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Gently shakes her
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Camera Moves In on the blinking green light
[%@!]
Wall places Eve in his charging spot
Aims her hovering form to face the sun
[%@!]
Several hot days pass with Wall holding vigil in the heat
[%@!]
Wall holds an Umbrella over Eve
Gets struck by lightning
Holds up another umbrella
[%@!]
Sandstorm blows through
Wall pops out of dune on the truck roof
Lifts up an Upside Down Barrel that protected Eve Wall pries open panel on Eve chest

Tries to pull out her hand to hold it
It snaps back into place trapping his hand
Wall has set up the Tv on the roof
The blank Eve floating next to him
Tries unsuccessfully to play Pong with her
[%@!]
Finally he gives up
Wall loads up his cooler
[%@!]
[%@!]
Heads off to work defeated
Wall simply going through the motions
[%@!]
[%@!]
Pulls out the Zippo lighter

[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it
Two Tug Rockets guide the ship in
It locks into Giant Braces fixed on the deck
The impact knocks Wall off
He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace
Suddenly the entire dock comes to life
Robotic arms of all types appear [%@!] service robots of all types appear
Rise from the floor
[%@!]
It is cacophony of automation

Nearly collides with merging Hover Chair
It blocks his way
Wall discovers sitting reclined in the chair
He is large like big baby [%@!] He is round like big baby [%@!] He is soft like big baby
Wears red Bnl jumpsuit
The chair seems to be steering itself
Guided by floor lines just like the robots
Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision
Holographic Screen floats inches in front of his face
He converses with Second Passenger on screen
Well have been in my cabin all morning so let us hover over to the driving range [%@!] Well have been in my cabin all morning so let us hit few virtual balls into space
