She sprang it on me before breakfast
There in seven words you have complete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha
could go on indefinitely about brutality [%@!] could go on indefinitely about lack of consideration
merely say that she routed me out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small hours
It can not have been half past eleven when Jeeves my man woke me out of the dreamless [%@!] It can not have been half past eleven when Jeeves my man broke the news Mrs Gregson to see you sir
thought she must be walking in her sleep [%@!] crawled out of bed [%@!] got into dressing gown
knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know that if she had come to see me she was going to see me
That is the sort of woman she is
She was sitting bolt upright in chair staring into space
When came in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me feel as if had gelatine where my spine ought to be
Aunt Agatha is one of those strong minded women
should think Queen Elizabeth must have been something like her
She bosses her husband Spencer Gregson battered little chappie on the Stock Exchange
She bosses my cousin Gussie Mannering Phipps
She bosses her sister in law Gussie mother
And worst of all she bosses me
She has an eye like man eating fish [%@!] she has got moral suasion down to fine point
if you are chappie like me fond of quiet life you simply curl into ball when you see her coming [%@!] if you are chappie like me fond of quiet life you simply hope for the best [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of blood do [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of iron do [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of blood you [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of iron you [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of blood all that sort of thing whom she could not intimidate [%@!] dare say there are fellows in the world men of iron all that sort of thing whom she could not intimidate
My experience is that when Aunt Agatha wants you to do thing you do it [%@!] My experience is that you find yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such fuss when they had trouble with the Spanish Inquisition
[%@!]
said Bertie she said you look sight
You look perfectly dissipated
was feeling like badly wrapped brown paper parcel
am never at my best in the early morning
[%@!]
[%@!]
had breakfast three hours ago and have been walking in the park ever since trying to compose my thoughts
If ever breakfasted at half past eight should walk on the Embankment trying to end it all in watery grave
am extremely worried Bertie
That is why have come to you
And then saw she was going to start something [%@!] And then bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea
But she had begun before could get it
What are your immediate plans Bertie
Well after that if felt strong enough might trickle off to Walton Heath for round of golf [%@!] Well rather thought of tottering out for bite of lunch later on [%@!] Well rather thought of then possibly staggering round to the club
am not interested in your totterings [%@!] am not interested in your tricklings
mean have you any important engagements in the next week or so
scented danger
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
What are they
[%@!]
[%@!]
You have no engagements
Very well then want you to start immediately for America
[%@!]
Do not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an empty stomach shortly after the rising of the lark
[%@!]
suppose even you have heard of America
[%@!]
Because that is where your Cousin Gussie is
He is in New York and can not get at him
What is Gussie been doing
Gussie is making perfect idiot of himself
To one who knew young Gussie as well as did the words opened up wide field for speculation
[%@!]
He has lost his head over creature
On past performances this rang true
Ever since he arrived at man estate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures
He is that sort of chap
But as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over him it had never amounted to much
imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America Bertie
You know how wickedly extravagant your Uncle Cuthbert was
She alluded to Gussie governor the late head of the family [%@!] am bound to say she spoke the truth
Nobody was fonder of old Uncle Cuthbert than was [%@!] everybody knows that where money was concerned he was the most complete chump in the annals of the nation
He had an expensive thirst
He never backed horse that did not get housemaid knee in the middle of the race
He had system of beating the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out the bunting when he was sighted in the offing [%@!] He had system of beating the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration ring the joy bells when he was sighted in the offing
Take him for all in all dear old Uncle Cuthbert was as willing spender as ever called the family lawyer bloodsucking vampire because he would not let Uncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another thousand
He left your Aunt Julia very little money for woman in her position
Beechwood requires great deal of keeping up [%@!] poor dear Spencer though he does his best to help has not unlimited resources
It was clearly understood why Gussie went to America
He is not clever [%@!] he is very good looking [%@!] though he has no title the Mannering Phippses are one of the best families in England [%@!] though he has no title the Mannering Phippses are one of the oldest families in England
He had some excellent letters of introduction [%@!] when he wrote home to say that he had met the most charming girl in the world felt quite happy [%@!] when he wrote home to say that he had met the most beautiful girl in the world felt quite happy
He continued to rave about her for several mails and then this morning letter has come from him in which he says quite casually as sort of afterthought that he knows we are broadminded enough not to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville stage
[%@!]
It was like thunderbolt
The girl name it seems is Ray Denison [%@!] according to Gussie she does something which he describes as single on the big time
What this degraded performance may be have not the least notion
As further recommendation he states that she lifted them out of their seats at Mosenstein last week
Who she may be can not tell you [%@!] how can not tell you [%@!] why can not tell you [%@!] who Mr Mosenstein may be can not tell you [%@!] what Mr Mosenstein may be can not tell you
By jove said it is like sort of thingummybob is not it
[%@!]
fail to understand you
Well Aunt Julia you know do not you know
[%@!]
What is bred in you know [%@!] bone will come out in the wash you know [%@!] all that kind of thing you know
Do not be absurd Bertie
That was all very well [%@!] it was coincidence for all that
Nobody ever mentions it am told [%@!] the family have been trying to forget it for twenty five years am told [%@!] it is known fact that my Aunt Julia Gussie mother was vaudeville artist once am told [%@!] it is known fact that my Aunt Julia Gussie mother was very good one am told [%@!] it is known fact that my Aunt Julia Gussie mother was too am told
She was playing in pantomime at Drury Lane when Uncle Cuthbert saw her first
with microscope you could not tell Aunt Julia from genuine dyed in the wool aristocrat [%@!] It was before before was old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it [%@!] It was long before was old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it [%@!] Aunt Agatha had pulled up her socks [%@!] Aunt Agatha had put in lot of educative work
Women adapt themselves so quickly
have pal who married Daisy Trimble of the Gaiety [%@!] when meet her now feel like walking out of her presence backwards
But there the thing was [%@!] But you could not get away from it
Gussie had vaudeville blood in him [%@!] it looked as if he were reverting to type [%@!] it looked as if he were reverting to whatever they call it
By Jove said for am interested in this heredity stuff perhaps the thing is going to be regular family tradition like you read about in books sort of Curse of the Mannering Phippses as it were
Perhaps each head of the family going to marry into vaudeville for ever [%@!] Perhaps each head of the family going to marry into vaudeville for ever
Unto the what you call it generation do not you know
Please do not be quite idiotic Bertie
There is one head of the family who is certainly not going to do it [%@!] that is Gussie
And you are going to America to stop him
[%@!]
[%@!]
You are too vexing Bertie
Have you no sort of feeling for the family
You are too lazy to try to be credit to yourself [%@!] at least you can exert yourself to prevent Gussie disgracing us
You are going to America because you are Gussie cousin because you have always been his closest friend because you are the only one of the family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf [%@!] You are going to America because you are Gussie cousin because you have always been his closest friend because you are the only one of the family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except night clubs
play lot of auction
And as you say idiotic gambling in low dens
If you require another reason you are going because ask you as personal favour
What she meant was that if refused she would exert the full bent of her natural genius to make life Hades for me
She held me with her glittering eye
have never met anyone who can give better imitation of the Ancient Mariner
So you will start at once will not you Bertie
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Of course will Jeeves came in with the tea
Jeeves said we start for America on Saturday
Very good sir he said which suit will you wear
New York is large city conveniently situated on the edge of America so that you step off the liner right on to it without an effort
You can not lose your way
there you are right in among it [%@!] You go out of barn [%@!] You go down some stairs
The only possible objection any reasonable chappie could find to the place is that they loose you into it from the boat at such an ungodly hour
left Jeeves to get my baggage safely past an aggregation of suspicious minded pirates who were digging for buried treasures among my new shirts [%@!] drove to Gussie hotel where requested the squad of gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him
That is where got my first shock
He was not there
pleaded with them to think again [%@!] they thought again [%@!] it was no good
[%@!]
[%@!]
There was alone in strange city [%@!] There was no signs of Gussie
What was the next step
am never one of the master minds in the early morning the old bean does not somehow seem to get into its stride till pretty late in the [%@!] am never one of the master minds in the early morning could not think what to do
However some instinct took me through door at the back of the lobby [%@!] However found myself in large room with an enormous picture stretching across the whole of one wall [%@!] However found myself in large room with under the picture counter [%@!] However found myself in large room with behind the counter divers chappies in white serving drinks
They have barmen do not you know in New York not barmaids
[%@!]
put myself unreservedly into the hands of one of the white chappies
He was friendly soul [%@!] told him the whole state of affairs
asked him what he thought would meet the case
He said that in situation of that sort he usually prescribed lightning whizzer an invention of his own
He said this was what rabbits trained on when they were matched against grizzly bears [%@!] He said there was only one instance on record of the bear having lasted three rounds
So tried couple
the man was perfectly right
As drained the second great load seemed to fall from my heart [%@!] As drained the second went out in quite braced way to have look at the city
was surprised to find the streets quite full
People were bustling along as if it were some reasonable hour [%@!] People were bustling along as if it were the grey dawn
In the tramcars they were absolutely standing on each other necks
Going to business take it [%@!] something take it
[%@!]
The odd part of it was that after the first shock of seeing all this frightful energy the thing did not seem so strange
have spoken to fellows since who have been to New York [%@!] they tell me they found it just the same
Apparently there is something in the air either the ozone which makes you sit up [%@!] Apparently there is something in the air either the ozone which makes you take notice [%@!] Apparently there is something in the air either the phosphates which makes you sit up [%@!] Apparently there is something in the air either the phosphates which makes you take notice [%@!] Apparently there is something in the air either something which makes you sit up [%@!] Apparently there is something in the air either something which makes you take notice
kind of zip as it were
sort of bally freedom if you know what mean that gets into your blood and bucks you up and makes you feel that God in His Heaven All right with the world and you do not care if you have got odd socks on
can not express it better than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind as walked about the place they call Times Square was that there were three thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha
It is funny thing about looking for things
If you hunt for needle in haystack you do not find it
If you do not give darn whether you ever see the needle it runs into you the first time you lean against the stack [%@!] If you do not give darn whether not it runs into you the first time you lean against the stack
By the time had strolled up once seeing the sights am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled up once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice seeing the sights am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled down once seeing the sights am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled down once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice seeing the sights am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system am dashed if did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad as large as life just turning in at doorway down the street [%@!] By the time had strolled up once seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up once seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled up twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down once seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down once seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down once letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice seeing the sights was feeling that would not care if never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if Gussie never met again [%@!] By the time had strolled down twice letting the white chappie corrective permeate my system was feeling that would not care if never met again
called after him so legged it in pursuit [%@!] called after him so caught him going into an office on the first floor [%@!] he did not hear me so legged it in pursuit [%@!] he did not hear me so caught him going into an office on the first floor
The name on the door was Abe Riesbitter Vaudeville Agent [%@!] from the other side of the door came the sound of many voices
He turned [%@!] He stared at me
[%@!]
What on earth are you doing
Where have you sprung from
When did you arrive
Landed this morning
went round to your hotel [%@!] they said you were not there
They had never heard of you
have changed my name
call myself George Wilson
[%@!]
Well you try calling yourself Augustus Mannering Phipps over here [%@!] Well you see how it strikes you
You feel perfect ass
do not know what it is about America [%@!] the broad fact is that it is not place where you can call yourself Augustus Mannering Phipps
And there is another reason
will tell you later
Bertie have fallen in love with the dearest girl in the world
The poor old nut looked at me in such deuced cat like way standing with his mouth open waiting to be congratulated that simply had not the heart to tell him that knew all about that already [%@!] The poor old nut looked at me in such deuced cat like way standing with his mouth open waiting to be congratulated that simply had not the heart to tell him that had come over to the country for the express purpose of laying him stymie
So congratulated him
Thanks awfully old man he said
It is bit premature [%@!] fancy it is going to be all right
Come along in here and will tell you about it
What do you want in this place
It looks rummy spot
Oh that is part of the story
will tell you the whole thing
We opened the door marked Waiting Room
never saw such crowded place in my life
The room was packed till the walls bulged
Gussie explained
Pros he said music hall artistes you know waiting to see old Abe Riesbitter
This is September the first vaudeville opening day
The early fall said Gussie who is bit of poet in his way is vaudeville springtime
All over the country as August wanes sparkling comediennes burst into bloom the sap stirs in the veins of tramp cyclists [%@!] All over the country as August wanes sparkling comediennes burst into bloom last year contortionists waking from their summer sleep tie themselves tentatively into knots
What mean is this is the beginning of the new season and everybody out hunting for bookings
But what do you want here
Oh have just got to see Abe about something
If you see fat man with about fifty seven chins come out of that door there grab him for that will be Abe
He is one of those fellows who advertise each step up they take in the world by growing another chin
am told that way back in the nineties he only had two
If you do grab Abe remember that he knows me as George Wilson
You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to me Gussie old man
Well it is this way At this juncture dear old Gussie broke off short [%@!] Well it is this way At this juncture dear old Gussie rose from his seat [%@!] Well it is this way At this juncture dear old Gussie sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie who had suddenly appeared
There was the deuce of rush for him for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] There was the deuce of rush for him for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] Gussie had got away to good start for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] Gussie had got away to good start for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the singers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the dancers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the jugglers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the acrobats seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the refined sketch teams seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and Gussie went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the singers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the dancers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the jugglers seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the acrobats seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room [%@!] the rest of the refined sketch teams seemed to recognize that he had won the trick for they ebbed back into their places again and went into the inner room
Mr Riesbitter lit cigar [%@!] Mr Riesbitter looked at us solemnly over his zareba of chins
Now let me tell ya something he said to Gussie
You lizzun me
Gussie registered respectful attention
Mr Riesbitter mused for moment [%@!] Mr Riesbitter shelled the cuspidor with indirect fire over the edge of the desk
Lizzun me he said again
seen you rehearse as promised Miss Denison would
You are not bad for an amateur
You got to lot to learn [%@!] it is in you
What it comes to is that can fix you up in the four day if you will take thirty five per
can not do better than that [%@!] would not have done that if the little lady had not of keep after me
Take it [%@!] leave it
What do you say
will take it said Gussie huskily
Thank you
In the passage outside Gussie gurgled with joy [%@!] In the passage outside Gussie slapped me on the back
Bertie old man it is all right
am the happiest man in New York
[%@!]
Well you see as was telling you when Abe came in Ray father used to be in the profession
He was before our time [%@!] remember hearing about him Joe Danby
He used to be well known in London before he came over to America
Well he did not like the idea of Ray marrying me because was not in the profession [%@!] Well he is fine old boy [%@!] Well he is as obstinate as mule
Would not hear of it
Well you remember at Oxford could always sing song pretty well so Ray got hold of old Riesbitter [%@!] Well you remember at Oxford could always sing song pretty well so Ray made him promise to come if he liked my work [%@!] Well you remember at Oxford could always sing song pretty well so Ray made him promise to hear me rehearse if he liked my work [%@!] Well you remember at Oxford could always sing song pretty well so Ray made him promise to get me bookings if he liked my work
She stands high with him
She coached me for weeks the darling
And now as you heard him say he is booked me in the small time at thirty five dollars week
steadied myself against the wall
The effects of the restoratives supplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off
Through sort of mist seemed to have vision of Aunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Mannering Phippses was about to appear on the vaudeville stage
Aunt Agatha worship of the family name amounts to an obsession
The Mannering Phippses were an old established clan when William the Conqueror was small boy going round with bare legs [%@!] The Mannering Phippses were an old established clan when William the Conqueror was small boy going round with catapult
there is practically nothing Mannering Phipps can do that does not blot his escutcheon [%@!] For centuries they have called kings by their first names [%@!] For centuries they have helped dukes with their weekly rent
So what Aunt Agatha would say beyond saying that it was all my fault when she learned the horrid news it was beyond me to imagine
Come back to the hotel Gussie said
There is sportsman there who mixes things he calls lightning whizzers
Something tells me need one now
And excuse me for one minute Gussie
want to send cable
It was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for this job of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American vaudeville profession
What needed was reinforcements
For moment thought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over [%@!] reason told me that this would be overdoing it
wanted assistance but not so badly as that
hit what seemed to me the happy mean
cabled to Gussie mother [%@!] made it urgent
What were you cabling about asked Gussie later
Oh just to say had all that sort of tosh answered
Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at rummy sort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time [%@!] Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at rummy sort of place uptown where they had one or two vaudeville acts
It had taken lot of careful handling to bring him up to scratch
could not let him down [%@!] He seemed to take my sympathy for granted [%@!] He seemed to take my assistance for granted
My only hope which grew as listened to him rehearsing was that he would be such frightful frost at his first appearance that he would never dare to perform again [%@!] as that would automatically squash the marriage it seemed best to me to let the thing go on
He was not taking any chances
On the Saturday we practically lived in beastly little music room at the offices of the publishers whose songs he proposed to use [%@!] On the Sunday we practically lived in beastly little music room at the offices of the publishers whose songs he proposed to use
little chappie with hooked nose sucked cigarette [%@!] little chappie with hooked nose played the piano all day
Nothing could tire that lad
He seemed to take personal interest in the thing
Gussie would cleat his throat and begin There is great big choo choo waiting at the deep
The Chappie Is that so
What is it waiting for
Gussie Waiting for me
The Chappie For you Gussie Waiting for me ee
The Chappie You do not say
Gussie For am off to Tennessee
The Chappie Now live at Yonkers
He did this all through the song
At first poor old Gussie asked him to stop [%@!] the chappie said No it was always done
It helped to get pep into the thing
He appealed to me whether the thing did not want bit of pep [%@!] said it wanted all the pep it could get
And the chappie said to Gussie There you are
So Gussie had to stand it
The other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs
He told me in hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of the songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them out of their seats at Mosenstein [%@!] He told me in hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of the songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them elsewhere
The fact seemed to give it sacred associations for him
You will scarcely believe me [%@!] the management expected Gussie to show up [%@!] the management expected Gussie to start performing at one of the clock in the afternoon
told him they could not be serious as they must know that he would be rolling out for bit of lunch at that hour [%@!] Gussie said this was the usual thing in the four day [%@!] Gussie said he did not suppose he would ever get any lunch again until he landed on the big time
was just condoling with him when found that he was taking it for granted that should be there at one of the clock too
My idea had been that should look in at night when if he survived he would be coming up for the fourth time so said good bye to the little lunch would been planning at rather decent tavern would discovered on Fifth Avenue [%@!] My idea had been that should look in at night when if he survived he would be coming up for the fourth time so trailed along [%@!] have never deserted pal in distress so said good bye to the little lunch would been planning at rather decent tavern would discovered on Fifth Avenue [%@!] have never deserted pal in distress so trailed along
They were showing pictures when reached my seat
It was one of those Western films where the cowboy jumps on his horse not knowing poor chump [%@!] It was one of those Western films where the cowboy rides across country at hundred miles an hour to escape the sheriff not knowing poor chump [%@!] It was one of those Western films where the cowboy rides across country at fifty miles an hour to escape the sheriff not knowing poor chump
that he might just as well stay where he is the sheriff having horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour without coughing
was just going to close my eyes when discovered that was sitting next to deucedly pretty girl [%@!] was just going to try to forget till they put Gussie name up when discovered that was sitting next to deucedly pretty girl
No let me be honest
When went in had seen that there was deucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat so had taken the next one
What happened now was that began as it were to drink her in
wished they would turn the lights up so that could see her better
She was rather small with great big eyes [%@!] She was rather small with ripping smile
It was shame to let all that run to seed so to speak in semi darkness
Suddenly the lights did go up [%@!] the orchestra began to play tune which though have not much of an ear for music seemed somehow familiar
The next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in purple frock coat and brown top hat grinned feebly at the audience tripped over his feet blushed and began to sing the Tennessee song
It was rotten
The poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it practically eliminated his voice
He sounded like some far off echo of the past yodelling through woollen blanket
For the first time since had heard that he was about to go into vaudeville felt faint hope creeping over me
was sorry for the wretched chap of course [%@!] there was no denying that the thing had its bright side
No management on earth would go on paying thirty five dollars week for this sort of performance
This was going to be Gussie first [%@!] This was going to be Gussie only
He would have to leave the profession
The old boy would say Unhand my daughter
And with decent luck saw myself leading Gussie on to the next England bound liner [%@!] And with decent luck saw myself handing him over intact to Aunt Agatha
He got through the song somehow [%@!] He limped off amidst roars of silence from the audience
There was brief respite [%@!] out he came again
He sang this time as if nobody loved him
Gussie handled it in such sad crushed way that there was genuine anguish in every line [%@!] As song it was not very pathetic song being all about coons spooning in June under the moon [%@!] As song it was not very pathetic song being all about coons spooning so on [%@!] As song it was not very pathetic song being all about coons spooning so forth
By the time he reached the refrain was nearly in tears
It seemed such rotten sort of world with all that kind of thing going on in it
He started the refrain [%@!] the most frightful thing happened
The girl next to me got up in her seat [%@!] The girl next to me chucked her head back [%@!] The girl next to me began to sing too
it was not really too because her first note stopped Gussie dead as if he had been pole axed
never felt so bally conspicuous in my life
huddled down in my seat [%@!] wished could turn my collar up
Everybody seemed to be looking at me
In the midst of my agony caught sight of Gussie
complete change had taken place in the old lad
He was looking most frightfully bucked
must say the girl was singing most awfully well [%@!] must say it seemed to act on Gussie like tonic
the end of it was that he went off the popular hero [%@!] When she came to the end of the refrain he took it up [%@!] When she came to the end of the refrain they sang it together
The audience yelled for more [%@!] The audience were only quieted when they turned down the lights [%@!] The audience were only quieted when they put on film
When had recovered tottered round to see Gussie
found him sitting on box behind the stage looking like one who had seen visions
Is not she wonder Bertie he said devoutly
had not notion she was going to be there
She is playing at the Auditorium this week [%@!] she can only just have had time to get back to her matinee
She risked being late just to come [%@!] She risked being late just to see me through
She is my good angel Bertie
She saved me
If she had not helped me out do not know what would have happened
was so nervous did not know what was doing
Now that have got through the first show shall be all right
was glad had sent that cable to his mother
was going to need her
The thing had got beyond me
During the next week saw lot of old Gussie [%@!] During the next week was introduced to the girl
also met her father formidable old boy with quick eyebrows [%@!] also met her father formidable old boy with sort of determined expression
On the following Wednesday Aunt Julia arrived
Mrs Mannering Phipps my aunt Julia is think the most dignified person know
She lacks Aunt Agatha punch [%@!] in quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel from boyhood up that was poor worm
Not that she harries me like Aunt Agatha
The difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys the impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the sin and sorrow in the world while Aunt Julia manner seems to suggest that am more to be pitied than censured
If it was not that the thing was matter of historical fact should be inclined to believe that Aunt Julia had never been on the vaudeville stage
She is like stage duchess
She always seems to me to be in perpetual state of being about to desire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the blue room overlooking the west terrace
She exudes dignity
Yet twenty five years ago so have been told by old boys who were lads about town in those days she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in double act called Fun in Tea Shop in which she wore tights [%@!] Yet twenty five years ago so have been told by old boys who were lads about town in those days she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in double act called Fun in Tea Shop in which she sang song with chorus that began Rumpty tiddley umpty ay
There are some things chappie mind absolutely refuses to picture [%@!] Aunt Julia singing Rumpty tiddley umpty ay is one of them
She got straight to the point within five minutes of our meeting
What is this about Gussie
Why did you cable for me Bertie
It is rather long story [%@!] It is complicated
If you do not mind will let you have it in series of motion pictures
Suppose we look in at the Auditorium for few minutes
The girl Ray had been re engaged for second week at the Auditorium owing to the big success of her first week
Her act consisted of three songs
She did herself well in the matter of costume [%@!] She did herself well in the matter of scenery
She had ripping voice
She looked most awfully pretty [%@!] altogether the act was broadly speaking pippin
Aunt Julia did not speak till we were in our seats
Then she gave sort of sigh
It is twenty five years since was in music hall
She did not say any more [%@!] She sat there with her eyes glued on the stage
After about half an hour the johnnies who work the card index system at the side of the stage put up the name of Ray Denison [%@!] there was good deal of applause
Watch this act Aunt Julia said
She did not seem to hear me
[%@!]
What did you say Bertie
Watch this act [%@!] tell me what you think of it
Who is it
[%@!]
[%@!]
Exhibit said
The girl Gussie engaged to
The girl did her act [%@!] the house rose at her
They did not want to let her go
She had to come back again [%@!] She had to come back again
When she had finally disappeared turned to Aunt Julia
[%@!]
like her work
She is an artist
We will now if you do not mind step goodish way uptown
And we took the subway to where Gussie the human film was earning his thirty five per
As luck would have it we had not been in the place ten minutes when out he came
Exhibit said
[%@!]
do not quite know what had expected her to do [%@!] certainly did not expect her to sit there without word
She did not move muscle [%@!] She just stared at Gussie as he drooled on about the moon
thought it best to let her get strangle hold on the intricacies of the situation as quickly as possible [%@!] was sorry for the woman for it must have been shock to her to see her only son in mauve frockcoat [%@!] was sorry for the woman for it must have been shock to her to see her only son in brown top hat
If had tried to explain the affair without the aid of illustrations should have talked all day [%@!] If had tried to explain the affair without the aid of illustrations should have left her muddled up as to who was going to marry whom [%@!] If had tried to explain the affair without the aid of illustrations should have left her muddled up as to why
was astonished at the improvement in dear old Gussie
He had got back his voice [%@!] He was putting the stuff over well
It reminded me of the night at Oxford when then but lad of eighteen he sang Let us All Go Down the Strand after bump supper standing the while up to his knees in the college fountain
He was putting just the same zip into the thing now
When he had gone off Aunt Julia sat perfectly still for long time [%@!] When he had gone off she turned to me
Her eyes shone queerly
What does this mean Bertie
She spoke quite quietly [%@!] her voice shook bit
Gussie went into the business said because the girl father would not let him marry her unless he did
If you feel up to it perhaps you would not mind having chat with him [%@!] If you feel up to it perhaps you would not mind tottering round to One Hundred Street [%@!] If you feel up to it perhaps you would not mind tottering round to One Thirty third Street
He is an old boy with eyebrows [%@!] he is Exhibit on my list
When have put you in touch with him rather fancy my share of the business is concluded [%@!] When have put you in touch with him rather fancy it is up to you
The Danbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if they cost the earth [%@!] The Danbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if they really cost about half as much as hall room down in the forties
We were shown into the sitting room [%@!] presently old Danby came in
Good afternoon Mr Danby began
had got as far as that when there was kind of gasping cry at my elbow
Joe cried Aunt Julia [%@!] Joe staggered against the sofa
For moment old Danby stared at her [%@!] then his mouth fell open [%@!] then his eyebrows shot up like rockets
[%@!]
And then they had got hold of each other hands [%@!] And then they were shaking them till wondered their arms did not come unscrewed
am not equal to this sort of thing at such short notice
The change in Aunt Julia made me feel quite dizzy
She had she would her grande dame manner completely [%@!] She was blushing [%@!] She was smiling
do not like to say such things of any aunt of mine [%@!] would put it on record that she was giggling
And old Danby who usually looked like cross between Roman emperor and Napoleon Bonaparte in bad temper was behaving like small boy
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
Wherever have you come from Julie
Well did not know what it was all about [%@!] Well felt bit out of it
butted in Aunt Julia wants to have talk with you Mr Danby
knew you in second Joe
It is twenty five years since saw you kid [%@!] you do not look day older
[%@!]
am an old woman
What are you doing over here
suppose old Danby cheerfulness waned trifle suppose your husband is with you
My husband died long long while ago Joe
Old Danby shook his head
You never ought to have married out of the profession Julie
am not saying word against the late can not remember his name never could [%@!] you should not have done it an artist like you
Shall ever forget the way you used to knock them with Rumpty tiddley umpty ay
[%@!]
how wonderful you were in that act Joe
Aunt Julia sighed
Do you remember the back fall you used to do down the steps
always have said that you did the best back fall in the profession
could not do it now
Do you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury Joe Think of it
The Canterbury moving picture house now [%@!] the old Mogul runs French revues
am glad am not there to see them
Joe tell me why did you leave England
Well wanted change
No will tell you the truth kid
wanted you Julie
You went off and it broke me all up [%@!] You married that whatever that stage door johnny name was and it broke me all up
Aunt Julia was staring at him
She is what they call well preserved woman
It is easy to see that twenty five years ago she must have been something quite extraordinary to look at
Even now she is almost beautiful
She has very large brown eyes [%@!] She has mass of soft grey hair [%@!] She has the complexion of girl of seventeen
Joe you are not going to tell me you were fond of me yourself
Of course was fond of you
Why did let you have all the fat in Fun in Tea Shop
Why did hang about upstage while you sang Rumpty tiddley umpty ay
Do you remember my giving you bag of buns when we were on the road at Bristol
Yes but Do you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at Portsmouth
[%@!]
Do you remember my giving you seed cake at Birmingham
What did you think all that meant if not that loved you
Why was working up by degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off [%@!] Why was working up by degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly married that cane sucking dude
That is why would not let my daughter marry this young chap Wilson unless he went into the profession
She is an artist She certainly is Joe
You have seen her
[%@!]
[%@!]
But Joe you must not stand in the way of her marrying the man she is in love with
He is an artist too
[%@!]
You were in the small time once Joe
You must not look down on him because he is beginner
know you feel that your daughter is marrying beneath her but How on earth do you know anything about young Wilson
He is my son
[%@!]
[%@!]
And have just been watching him work
Oh Joe you can not think how proud was of him
He is got it in him
It is fate
He is my son [%@!] he is in the profession
Joe you do not know what have been through for his sake
They made lady of me
never worked so hard in my life as did to become real lady
They kept telling me had got to put it across no matter what it cost so that he would not be ashamed of me
The study was something terrible
had to watch myself every minute for years [%@!] never knew when might fluff my lines [%@!] never knew when might fall down on some bit of business
But did it because did not want him to be ashamed of me though all the time was just aching to be back where belonged
Old Danby made jump at her [%@!] Old Danby took her by the shoulders
Come back where you belong Julie
he cried
[%@!]
[%@!]
It is twenty five years ago
want you still
have always wanted you
You have got to come back kid where you belong
Aunt Julia gave sort of gulp [%@!] Aunt Julia looked at him
[%@!]
she said in kind of whisper
You are here kid said Old Danby huskily
You have come back
[%@!]
[%@!]
You have come back [%@!] you are going to stay
She pitched forward into his arms [%@!] he caught her
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
she said
Hold me
Do not let me go
Take care of me
And edged for the door [%@!] And slipped from the room
[%@!]
The old bean will stand certain amount [%@!] this was too much
groped my way out into the street [%@!] wailed for taxi
Gussie called on me at the hotel that night
He curveted into the room as if he had bought it [%@!] He curveted into the room as if he had bought the rest of the city
Bertie he said feel as if were dreaming
wish could feel like that old top said [%@!] took another glance at cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha
had been looking at it at intervals ever since
Ray got back to her flat this evening [%@!] got back to her flat this evening
Who do you think was there
[%@!]
She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby
[%@!]
He was sitting hand in hand with her
[%@!]
They are going to be married
[%@!]
Ray are going to be married
[%@!]
Bertie old man feel immense
look round me [%@!] everything seems to be absolutely corking
The change in the mater is marvellous
She is twenty five years younger
She are talking of reviving Fun in Tea Shop [%@!] She are talking of going out on the road with it [%@!] old Danby are talking of reviving Fun in Tea Shop [%@!] old Danby are talking of going out on the road with it
[%@!]
Gussie old top said leave me for while
[%@!]
think have got brain fever or something
Sorry old man perhaps New York does not agree with you
When do you expect to go back to England
looked again at Aunt Agatha cable
With luck said in about ten years
When he was gone took up the cable [%@!] When he was gone read it again
What is happening

[%@!]
sucked pencil for while [%@!] wrote the reply
It was not an easy cable to word [%@!] managed it
No wrote stay where you are
Profession overcrowded
