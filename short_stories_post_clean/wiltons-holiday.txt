When Jack Wilton first came to Marois Bay none of us dreamed that he was man with hidden sorrow in his life
There was something about the man which made the idea absurd [%@!] There was something about the man which would have made it absurd if he himself had not been the authority for the story
He looked so thoroughly pleased with life [%@!] He looked so thoroughly pleased with himself
He was one of those men whom you instinctively label in your mind as strong
He was so healthy so fit that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you would have selected as the recipient of that hard luck story of yours [%@!] He had such confident yet sympathetic look about him that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you would have selected as the recipient of that hard luck story of yours
You felt that his kindly strength would have been something to lean on
As matter of fact it was by trying to lean on it that Spencer Clay got hold of the facts of the case and when young Clay got hold of anything Marois Bay at large had it hot and fresh
few hours later for Spencer was one of those slack jawed youths who are constitutionally incapable of preserving secret
Within two hours then of Clay chat with Wilton everyone in the place knew that jolly as the new comer might seem there was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply heroic [%@!] Within two hours then of Clay chat with Wilton everyone in the place knew that hearty as the new comer might seem there was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply heroic
Clay it seems who is the worst specimen of self pitier had gone to Wilton in whom as new comer he naturally saw fine fresh repository for his tales of woe [%@!] Clay it seems who is the worst specimen of self pitier had gone to Wilton in whom as new comer he naturally had opened with long yarn of some misfortune [%@!] Clay it seems who is the worst specimen of self pitier had gone to Wilton in whom as new comer he naturally had opened with long yarn of other
forget which it was it might have been any one of dozen or so which he had constantly in stock [%@!] forget which it was it is immaterial which it was
The point is that having heard him out very politely Wilton came back at him with story which silenced even Clay [%@!] The point is that having heard him out very patiently Wilton came back at him with story which silenced even Clay
Spencer was equal to most things [%@!] even he could not go on whining about how he had foozled his putting [%@!] even he could not go on whining about how he had been snubbed at the bridge table [%@!] even he could not go on whining about how he had whatever it was that he was pitying himself about just then when man was telling him the story of wrecked life
He told me not to let it go any further [%@!] of course it does not matter telling you
It is thing he does not like to have known
He told me because he said there was something about me that seemed to extract confidences kind of strength he said
You would not think it to look at him [%@!] his life is an absolute blank
Absolutely ruined do not you know
He told me the whole thing so simply that it broke me all up [%@!] He told me the whole thing so frankly that it broke me all up
It seems that he was engaged to be married few years ago and on the wedding morning absolutely on the wedding morning the girl was taken suddenly ill and And died
[%@!]
Died in his arms
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
He is never got over it
You will not let it go any further will you old man
And off sped Spencer to tell the tale to someone else
Everyone was terribly sorry for Wilton
He was such good fellow that one hated the thought that laugh as he might beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that awful memory [%@!] He was such sportsman that one hated the thought that laugh as he might beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that awful memory [%@!] He was so young that one hated the thought that laugh as he might beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that awful memory
He seemed so happy too
It was only in moments of confidence in those heart to heart talks when men reveal their deeper feelings that he ever gave hint that all was not well with him
As for example when Ellerton who is always in love with someone backed him into corner one evening he had hardly begun when such look of pain came over Wilton face that he ceased instantly [%@!] As for example when Ellerton who is always in love with someone began to tell him the story of his latest affair he had hardly begun when such look of pain came over Wilton face that he ceased instantly
He said afterwards that the sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like bullet [%@!] He said afterwards that the manner in which he turned the conversation practically without pausing from love to discussion of the best method of getting out of the bunker at the seventh hole was in the circumstances triumph of tact
Marois Bay is quiet place even in the summer [%@!] the Wilton tragedy was naturally the subject of much talk
It is sobering thing to get glimpse of the underlying sadness of life like that [%@!] there was disposition at first on the part of the community to behave in his presence in manner reminiscent of pall bearers at funeral
But things soon adjusted themselves
He was outwardly so cheerful that it seemed ridiculous for the rest of us to step softly [%@!] He was outwardly so cheerful that it seemed ridiculous for the rest of us to speak with hushed voices
After all when you came to examine it the thing was his affair [%@!] After all when you came to examine it it was for him to dictate the lines on which it should be treated
If he elected to hide his pain under bright smile our line was obviously to follow his lead [%@!] If he elected to hide his pain under laugh like that of hyena with more than usually keen sense of humour our line was obviously to follow his lead
We did so [%@!] by degrees the fact that his life was permanently blighted became almost legend
At the back of our minds we were aware of it [%@!] it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day
It was only when someone forgetting as Ellerton had done tried to enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of pain in his eyes reminded us that he still remembered [%@!] It was only when someone forgetting as Ellerton had done tried to enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that he still remembered
Matters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell arrived
Sex attraction is so purely question of the taste of the individual that the wise man never argues about it
He accepts its vagaries as part of the human mystery [%@!] He leaves it at that
To me there was no charm whatever about Mary Campbell
anyway she left me cold [%@!] It may have been that at the moment was in love with Grace Bates for at Marois Bay in the summer man who is worth his salt is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously [%@!] It may have been that at the moment was in love with Heloise Miller for at Marois Bay in the summer man who is worth his salt is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously [%@!] It may have been that at the moment was in love with Clarice Wembley for at Marois Bay in the summer man who is worth his salt is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously
Not one thrill could she awake in me
She was small [%@!] She was insignificant
Some men said that she had fine eyes
They seemed to me just ordinary eyes
And her hair was just ordinary hair
In fact ordinary was the word that described her
But from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton which was all the more remarkable seeing that he was the one man of us all who could have got any girl in Marois Bay that he wanted
When man is six foot high his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth [%@!] When man is combination of Hercules his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth [%@!] When man is combination of Apollo his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth [%@!] When man plays tennis with almost superhuman vim his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth [%@!] When man plays golf with almost superhuman vim his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth [%@!] When man plays the banjo with almost superhuman vim his path with the girls of summer seaside resort is pretty smooth
But when you add to all these things tragedy like Wilton he can only be described as having walk over
Girls love tragedy
At least most girls do
It makes man interesting to them
Grace Bates was always going on about how interesting Wilton was
So was Heloise Miller
So was Clarice Wembley
But it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real enthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois Bay
We put it down to the fact that he could not forget [%@!] the real reason now know was that he considered that girls were nuisance on the links [%@!] the real reason now know was that he considered that girls were nuisance in the tennis court
suppose plus two golfer such as Wilton was does feel like that [%@!] suppose Wildingesque tennis player such as Wilton was does feel like that
Personally think that girls add to the fun of the thing
my handicap is twelve [%@!] though have been playing tennis for many years doubt if have got my first serve the fast one over the net more than half dozen times
But Mary Campbell overcame Wilton prejudices in twenty four hours
He seemed to feel lonely on the links without her [%@!] he positively egged her to be his partner in the doubles
What Mary thought of him we did not know
She was one of those inscrutable girls
And so things went on
If it had not been that knew Wilton story should have classed the thing as one of those summer love affairs to which the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive
The only reason why anyone comes away from summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed is because there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his holiday is up before he can so to speak concentrate
But in Wilton case this was out of the question
man does not get over the sort of blow he had had not at any rate for many years [%@!] we had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent
doubt if was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he confided in me
Why he should have chosen me as confidant can not say
Wilton chose the lesser evil [%@!] am inclined to think that happened to be alone with him at the psychological moment when man must confide in somebody [%@!] am inclined to think that happened to be alone with him at the psychological moment when man must burst
was strolling along the shore after dinner smoking cigar when happened upon him [%@!] was strolling along the shore after dinner thinking of Grace Bates when happened upon him [%@!] was strolling along the shore after dinner thinking of Heloise Miller when happened upon him [%@!] was strolling along the shore after dinner thinking of Clarice Wembley when happened upon him
It was beautiful night [%@!] we sat down for while [%@!] we drank it in for while
The first intimation had that all was not well with him was when he suddenly emitted hollow groan
The next moment he had begun to confide
am in the deuce of hole he said
What would you do in my position
[%@!]
proposed to Mary Campbell this evening
[%@!]
[%@!]
She refused me
Refused you
[%@!]
It seemed to me that the narrative required footnotes
Who is Amy
[%@!]
Amy is the girl Which girl
The girl who died you know
Mary had got hold of the whole story
In fact it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to propose
If it had not been for that should not have had the nerve
am not fit to black her shoes
Odd the poor opinion man always has when he is in love of his personal attractions
There were times when thought of Grace Bates when felt like one of the beasts that perish [%@!] There were times when thought of Heloise Miller when felt like one of the beasts that perish [%@!] There were times when thought of Clarice Wembley when felt like one of the beasts that perish
But then am nothing to write home about whereas the smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was kind of Ouida guardsman
This evening managed somehow to do it
She was tremendously nice about it said she was very fond of me but it was quite out of the question because of Amy [%@!] She was tremendously nice about it said she all that but it was quite out of the question because of Amy
do not follow this
What did she mean
It is perfectly clear if you bear in mind that Mary is the most sensitive spiritual highly strung girl that ever drew breath said Wilton little coldly
Her position is this she feels that because of Amy she can never have my love completely between us there would always be Amy memory
It would be the same as if she married widower
Well widowers marry
They do not marry girls like Mary
could not help feeling that this was bit of luck for the widowers
One has always got to remember that opinions differ about girls
One man peach so to speak is another man poison
have met men who did not like Grace Bates men who if Heloise Miller had given them their photographs would have used them to cut the pages of novel [%@!] have met men who did not like Grace Bates men who if Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs would have used them to cut the pages of novel
Amy stands between us said Wilton
breathed sympathetic snort
could not think of anything noticeably suitable to say
Stands between us repeated Wilton
And the damn silly part of the whole thing is that there is not any Amy
invented her
You what Invented her
Made her up
[%@!]
had reason
Let me see you come from London do not you
[%@!]
Then you have not any friends
It is different with me
live in small country town [%@!] everyone is my friend
do not know what it is about me [%@!] for some reason ever since can remember have been looked on as the strong man of my town the man who is all right
Am making myself clear
[%@!]
Well what am trying to get at is this
Either and have obviously never been sick in my life the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that can not possibly have any troubles of my own [%@!] Either and have obviously never been sick in my life the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry [%@!] Either because can not help looking pretty cheerful the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that can not possibly have any troubles of my own [%@!] Either because can not help looking pretty cheerful the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry [%@!] Either because am strong sort of fellow to look at the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that can not possibly have any troubles of my own [%@!] Either because the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that can not possibly have any troubles of my own [%@!] Either because am strong sort of fellow to look at the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry [%@!] Either because the whole of Bridley in the Wold seems to take it for granted that am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry
have the sympathetic manner [%@!] they come to me to be cheered up
If fellow in love he makes bee line for me [%@!] If fellow in love he tells me all about it
If anyone has had bereavement am the rock on which he leans for support
Well am patient sort of man [%@!] Well as far as Bridley in the Wold is concerned am willing to play the part
But strong man does need an occasional holiday [%@!] But made up my mind that would get it
[%@!]
saw that the same old game was going to start
Spencer Clay swooped down on me at once
am as big draw with the Spencer Clay type of maudlin idiot as catnip is with cat
Well could stand it at home [%@!] Well was hanged if was going to have my holiday spoiled
So invented Amy
Now do you see
[%@!]
And perceive something else which you appear to have overlooked
If Amy does not exist or rather never did exist she can not stand between you and Miss Campbell
Tell her what you have told me [%@!] all will be well
He shook his head
You do not know Mary
She would never forgive me
You do not know what sympathy what angelic sympathy she has poured out on me about Amy
can not possibly tell her the whole thing was fraud
It would make her feel so foolish
You must risk it
At the worst you lose nothing
He brightened little
No that is true he said
have half mind to do it
Make it whole mind [%@!] you win out
[%@!]
[%@!]
The trouble was apparently that did not know Mary
am sure Grace Bates would not have acted as she did [%@!] am sure Heloise Miller would not have acted as she did [%@!] am sure Clarice Wembley would not have acted as she did
They might have been trifle stunned at first but they would soon have come round [%@!] They might have been trifle stunned at first but all would have been joy
[%@!]
What took place at the interview do not know [%@!] it was swiftly perceived by Marois Bay that the Wilton Campbell alliance was off
They no longer walked together [%@!] They no longer golfed together [%@!] They no longer played tennis on the same side of the net
They did not even speak to each other
The rest of the story can speak of only from hearsay
How it became public property do not know
But there was confiding strain in Wilton [%@!] But imagine he confided in someone who confided in someone else
At any rate it is recorded in Marois Bay unwritten archives from which now extract it
For some days after the breaking off of diplomatic relations Wilton seemed too pulverized to resume the offensive
He mooned about the links by himself playing shocking game [%@!] He generally comported himself like man who has looked for the escape of gas with lighted candle
In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the most spineless lack of resolution
Wilton weighed thirteen stone [%@!] his muscles were like steel cables [%@!] he could not have shown less pluck in this crisis in his life if he had been poached egg
It was pitiful to see him
Mary in these days simply could not see that he was on the earth
She looked round him which was rotten from Wilton point of view for he had developed sort of wistful expression am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath which should have worked wonders if only he could have got action with it [%@!] She looked above him which was rotten from Wilton point of view for he had developed sort of wistful expression am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath which should have worked wonders if only he could have got action with it [%@!] She looked through him which was rotten from Wilton point of view for he had developed sort of wistful expression am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath which should have worked wonders if only he could have got action with it [%@!] She looked at him which was rotten from Wilton point of view for he had developed sort of wistful expression am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath which should have worked wonders if only he could have got action with it
But she avoided his eye as if he had been creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street
She irritated me
To let the breach widen in this way was absurd
Wilton when said as much to him said that it was due to her wonderful sensitiveness [%@!] Wilton when said as much to him said that it was due to her highly strungness [%@!] Wilton when said as much to him said that it was just one more proof to him of the loftiness of her soul [%@!] Wilton when said as much to him said that it was just one more proof to him of her shrinking horror of any form of deceit
In fact he gave me the impression that though the affair was rending his vitals he took mournful pleasure in contemplating her perfection
Now one afternoon Wilton took his misery for long walk along the seashore
He tramped over the sand for some considerable time [%@!] He finally pulled up in little cove backed by high cliffs [%@!] He finally pulled up in little cove dotted with rocks
The shore around Marois Bay is full of them
By this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort [%@!] By this time it struck Wilton that he could be great deal more comfortable nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than tramping any farther over the sand
Most of the Marois Bay scenery is simply made as setting for the nursing of wounded heart
even on the finest days the sea has curious sullen look [%@!] The cliffs are sombre indigo sinister [%@!] The cliffs are sombre indigo forbidding
you can simply wallow in misery [%@!] You have only to get away from the crowd near the bathing machines [%@!] You have only to reach one of these small coves [%@!] You have only to get your book against rock [%@!] You have only to get your pipe well alight
have done it myself
The day when Heloise Miller went golfing with Teddy Bingley spent the whole afternoon in one of these retreats
It is true that after twenty minutes of contemplating the breakers fell asleep [%@!] that is bound to happen
It happened to Wilton
For perhaps half an hour he brooded [%@!] then his pipe fell from his mouth [%@!] then he dropped off into peaceful slumber
And time went by
It was touch of cramp that finally woke him
He jumped up with yell [%@!] He stood there massaging his calf
And he had hardly got rid of the pain when startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness [%@!] And he had hardly got rid of the pain when there on the other side of the rock was Mary Campbell
Now if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at all he would have been tremendously elated
girl does not creep out to distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him all he had to do was to show bit of determination [%@!] girl does not creep out to distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him all he had to do was to get the whole thing straightened out [%@!] girl does not creep out to distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy and was unhappy about him all he had to do was to show bit of determination [%@!] girl does not creep out to distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy and was unhappy about him all he had to do was to get the whole thing straightened out
But Wilton whom grief had reduced to the mental level of an oyster did not reason this out [%@!] But the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties including speech
He just stood there [%@!] He just yammered
Did you follow me here Mr Wilton said Mary very coldly
He shook his head
Eventually he managed to say that he had come there by chance [%@!] Eventually he managed to say that he had fallen asleep under the rock
As this was exactly what Mary had done she could not reasonably complain
So that concluded the conversation for the time being
She walked away in the direction of Marois Bay without another word [%@!] presently he lost sight of her round bend in the cliffs
His position now was exceedingly unpleasant
If she had such distaste for his presence common decency made it imperative that he should give her good start on the homeward journey
He could not tramp along couple of yards in the rear all the way
So he had to remain where he was till she had got well off the mark
And as he was wearing thin flannel suit and the sun had gone in his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical discomfort [%@!] And as he was wearing thin flannel suit and breeze had sprung up his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical discomfort
Just as he had decided that he could now make move he was surprised to see her coming back
Wilton really was elated at this
The construction he put on it was that she had relented [%@!] The construction he put on it was that she was coming back to fling her arms round his neck
He was just bracing himself for the clash when he caught her eye [%@!] it was as cold as the sea [%@!] it was as unfriendly as the sea
must go round the other way she said
The water has come up too far on that side
And she walked past him to the other end of the cove
The prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow
The wind had now grown simply freezing [%@!] it came through his thin suit [%@!] it roamed about all over him in manner that caused him exquisite discomfort
He began to jump to keep himself warm
He was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time when chancing to glance to one side he perceived Mary again returning
By this time his physical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his bosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation
It was not fair he felt that she should jockey at the start in this way [%@!] It was not fair he felt that she should keep him hanging about here catching cold
He looked at her when she came within range quite balefully
It is impossible she said to get round that way either
One grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly that the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her
From where she stood in the middle of the cove the sea looked so distant that the fact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment merely annoying
She felt much the same as she would have felt if she had arrived at station to catch train [%@!] She felt much the same as she would have felt if she had been told that the train was not running
She therefore seated herself on rock [%@!] She therefore contemplated the ocean
Wilton walked up [%@!] Wilton walked down
Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man in class of his own above the ox [%@!] Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man in class of his own above the ass [%@!] Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man in class of his own above the common wart hog [%@!] Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man in class of his own above the rest of the lower animals
It was only when wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke the silence
The tide is coming in she faltered
She looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed different sea altogether
There was plenty of it to look at
It filled the entire mouth of the little bay swirling up the sand swim [%@!] It filled the entire mouth of the little bay lashing among the rocks in fashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her mind the recollection that she could not swim
[%@!]
Wilton bowed coldly
[%@!]
It is coming In
Wilton glanced superciliously at the sea
So he said perceive
But what shall we do
Wilton shrugged his shoulders
He was feeling at war with Nature combined [%@!] He was feeling at war with Humanity combined
The wind had shifted few points to the east [%@!] The wind was exploring his anatomy with the skill of qualified surgeon
We shall drown cried Miss Campbell
We shall drown
We shall drown
We shall drown
All Wilton resentment left him
Until he heard that pitiful wail his only thoughts had been for himself
[%@!]
he said with wealth of tenderness in his voice
She came to him as little child comes to its mother [%@!] he put his arm around her
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
[%@!]
It is in moments of peril when the chill breath of fear blows upon our souls clearing them of pettiness that we find ourselves
She looked about her wildly
Could we climb the cliffs
doubt it
If we called for help We could do that
They raised their voices [%@!] the only answer was the crashing of the waves [%@!] the only answer was the cry of the sea birds
The water was swirling at their feet [%@!] they drew back to the shelter of the cliffs
There they stood in silence watching
Mary said Wilton in low voice tell me one thing
Yes Jack Have you forgiven me
Forgiven you
How can you ask at moment like this
love you with all my heart [%@!] love you with all my soul
He kissed her [%@!] strange look of peace came over his face
[%@!]
[%@!]
fleck of foam touched her face [%@!] she shivered
It was worth it he said quietly
If all misunderstandings are cleared away it is small price to pay unpleasant as it will be when it comes [%@!] If nothing can come between us again it is small price to pay unpleasant as it will be when it comes
Perhaps perhaps it will not be very unpleasant
They say that drowning is an easy death
[%@!]
meant cold in the head
[%@!]
He nodded gravely
do not see how it can be avoided
You know how chilly it gets these late summer nights
It will be long time before we can get away
She laughed shrill unnatural laugh
You are talking like this to keep my courage up
You know in your heart that there is no hope for us
Nothing can save us now
The water will come creeping creeping Let it creep
It can not get past that rock there
What do you mean
It can not
The tide does not come up any farther
know because was caught here last week
For moment she looked at him without speaking
Then she uttered cry in which relief were so nicely blended that it would have been impossible to say which predominated [%@!] Then she uttered cry in which surprise were so nicely blended that it would have been impossible to say which predominated [%@!] Then she uttered cry in which indignation were so nicely blended that it would have been impossible to say which predominated
He was eyeing the approaching waters with an indulgent smile
Why did not you tell me
she cried
did tell you
You know what mean
Why did you let me go on thinking we were in danger when We were in danger
We shall probably get pneumonia
[%@!]
[%@!]
You are sneezing already
[%@!]
That was an exclamation of disgust
It sounded like sneeze
It must have been for you have every reason to sneeze can not imagine [%@!] It must have been why you should utter exclamations of disgust can not imagine
am disgusted with you with your meanness
You deliberately tricked me into saying Saying She was silent
What you said was that you loved me with all your heart [%@!] What you said was that you loved me with all your soul
You can not get away from that [%@!] it is good enough for me
Well it is not true any longer
Yes it is said Wilton comfortably bless it
It is not
shall never speak to you again
She moved away from him [%@!] She prepared to sit down
There is jelly fish just where you are going to sit said Wilton
[%@!]
It will
speak from experience as one on whom you have sat so often
[%@!]
Have patience
can be funnier than that
Please do not talk to me
[%@!]
She seated herself with her back to him
Dignity demanded reprisals so he seated himself with his back to her and the futile ocean raged towards them [%@!] Dignity demanded reprisals so he seated himself with his back to her and the wind grew chillier every minute
Time passed
Darkness fell
The little bay became black cavern dotted here with white where the breeze whipped the surface of the water [%@!] The little bay became black cavern dotted there with white where the breeze whipped the surface of the water
Wilton sighed
It was lonely sitting there all by himself
How much jollier it would have been if hand touched his shoulder [%@!] How much jollier it would have been if voice spoke meekly
Jack dear it it is awfully cold
Do not you think if we were to snuggle up He reached out an embrace which would have aroused the professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt [%@!] Do not you think if we were to snuggle up He reached out an embrace which would have drawn guttural congratulations from Zbysco [%@!] Do not you think if we were to snuggle up He folded her in an embrace which would have aroused the professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt [%@!] Do not you think if we were to snuggle up He folded her in an embrace which would have drawn guttural congratulations from Zbysco
She creaked beneath the strain [%@!] She did not crack beneath the strain
That is much nicer she said softly
Jack do not think the tide started even to think of going down yet
hope not said Wilton
