Production Draft June 27, 1994 CLOSE ON A FACE.  
A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide with wonder.
watching something intently.  
We HEAR the sounds of the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.
A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering to his wound.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of view, as they steer him away.
YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A. SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone... COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim corridor.  
He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.
Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR Flashlights glare.
In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures, GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.
COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...
JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  
What there is of it is youthful.  
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!
JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.
COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.
COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.
COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor, steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  
The heavy door clangs shut behind him.  
He's alone.  
COLE'S breath comes quicker now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.
On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  
He looks down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.
The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.
COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.
The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.
Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.
A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved aside.  
COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in moonlight!  
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  
No people anywhere.  
The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.
COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for something.  
Finds it.  
An insect.
COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  
As he clumsily inserts it into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
There's something across the street in the dark.  
Something alive.
COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  
Startled by the light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.
Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked floor and gets another specimen.  
DOGSHIT!
The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.
Then, a different SOUND.  
GRRRR!  
A dog.  
More GRRRRS.  
More dogs.  
Then, a YIP.  
Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  
It's a DOGFIGHT!
A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.
COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and puts it into one of his specimen tubes.
Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  
There's nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.
As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the building.  
COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  
Over it is written, "WE DID IT!"
COLE looks up.
COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.
ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.
Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on long poles  wielded by two HULKING FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their windowed masks.  
It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp, dripping walls.  
From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,.
COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.
Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.
COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick plastic in the rusty iron wall.  
VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk behind the translucent aperture, studying him.
The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.
Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.
COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts... a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER, BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  
They represent a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude, outdated, patched-together technologies.
COLE'S eyes return to the walls.
Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  
NO CURE YET!".
COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.
The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.
COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.
The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  
They just study him carefully.
COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.
As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall.  
One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  
Another features a photo of an OLD MAN and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".
Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.
BLACKNESS.  
Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  
But we HEAR their VOICES.
The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A. SYSTEM at the airport.
THE DREAM AGAIN!  
But at an earlier moment.  
YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse leading to the departure gates.
Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the monotonous airport routine.  
As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR.
PONYTAIL, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.
YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.
Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"
YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running.  
A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
COLE comes abruptly awake.  
Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.
The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.
COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the ENGINEER speaks to him.
COLE keeps his face impassive.
COLE gives away nothing.  
He's in a box here.  
He has no choices.
He stares at the tapping pencil.
A strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  
Extravagant paintings adorn the walls.  
A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty seated on folding chairs.
As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  
Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty- eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  
She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  
BEEP!  
BEEP!
BEEP!  
BEEP!  
Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed.  
As she makes her way to an exit, the glaring POET continues...
DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.
FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks right at her.  
In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.
COLE stares at RAILLY.  
The environment is intensely real...vivid colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud... and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.
COLE looks stunned.
COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.
POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.
Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.
A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  
The Police Department logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.
Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  
COLE stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants, PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.
As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and starts inspecting his scalp...
COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.
COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the large room.  
His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where light pours in from outside.  
Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.
PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.
BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON, a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.
As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.
COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.
COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting, THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.
A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.
Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and continues, completely calm now.  
But COLE isn't listening.  
He's mesmerized by the TV.
This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.
Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.
The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.
COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.
RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR.
OWEN FLETCHER, sit around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  
(Some of the DOCTORS bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.).
Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE is just grabbing a pad and pencil.
FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.
COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.
DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  
This is an old story, apparently.
COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  
COLE'S seen that tapping before -- in the future!  
It disorients him.
COLE doesn't answer.  
He's staring at the tapping pencil.
Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.
COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.
Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER lunges for the phone, answers sharply...
The MOTHER slams down the phone.
A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  
Sympathetically, RAILLY takes it from him.
COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  
Nuts?
RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.
RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.
MR.
PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.
Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  
It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.
TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.  
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!
Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  
It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  
He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew!
A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  
Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
Everything goes white!
COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.
He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  
Disoriented.
Which world is this?  
The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING, occasional MOANS.  
He can barely discern the shadowy figures of an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.
With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.
COLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree.  
Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.
ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.
Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.
COLE checks the grill anyway.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.  
He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND.  
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.
The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.
For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS.  
Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off.
Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!
As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER.
No alternative.  
COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on... PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.
COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.
ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/
A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached to his tiny, restrained body.
ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.
COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes the seat next to him.
ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles, eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.
The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of their experiments passively.
ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.
As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.
Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.
ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...
ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.
ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.
COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.
JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  
A KEY!
ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.
ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.
ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a beeper, calling for help.
ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.
ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  
Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just completed the puzzle stares, very upset.
Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.
ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY is sending a message to him.  
COLE looks at the ward door.
COLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.
ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  
He locks at the door...
blurring in and out of focus.  
He looks down at the key in his hand.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  
JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  
He reaches it and tries to insert the key in the lock.
ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.
ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.
COLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.
ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  
It won't turn.
A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.
COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  
It turns.
COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  
Then, he opens the door.
Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room facing several elevators.
A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even lock up from the magazine he's reading.
Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his back is to the SECURITY MAN.  
But he doesn't know how to control this elevator.  
What should he do?
COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.
COLE'S POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  
He's a big guy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  
He looks exactly like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!
ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!
Just then, an elevator door slides open.  
The elevator's empty.
COLE steps into it.
The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.
COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator springs to life.  
The numbers on the indicator over the door start to rise-  7..-8..-9.
Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.
Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.
COLE hesitates.
They look at him.  
They seem to expect him to exit.
Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.
As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.
RAILLY has just arrived for work.  
She's slipping on her white doctor's coat when...
DR.
CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.
CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.
She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.
CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS, sticks his head in the door.  
He's upset.
RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.
The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.
It's COLE!  
He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.
The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.
COLE turns and rushes back out the door.
COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.
A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.
COLE turns to his left.
Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.
COLE'S trapped.  
A beat.  
He attacks the nearest man.  BILLINGS.
RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense for more trouble.  
One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.
RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.
DR.
FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  
DR.
CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR.
MARILOU MARTIN are also there.
But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.
DR.
FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN, GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.
DR.
FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.
Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...
YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.
MR.
PONYTAIL bumps him.
The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  
The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!
TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE running after the BLONDE MAN!  
But this time, YOUNG COLE catches just a glimpse of her face.  
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
and the flashy earrings.  
She calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...
As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...
COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  
It's a beat-up old tape recorder.
The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...
The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  
Then,.
The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.
Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST staring at COLE intently.  
For one moment, the face belongs to COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.
COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.
COLE comes awake with a start.  
The room is dark now, except... a slide is being projected on a torn screen.  
It's a picture of a stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
Another slide CLICKS into place.  
Youthful PROTESTERS, their placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities, confront POLICE in riot gear.
Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the PROTESTERS.  
The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will recognize some of them later on).
The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the PROTESTERS.  
In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.
The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.
COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
COLE opens his eyes.  
Where is he?  Silence as he examines the tiny cell.  
Bare cement walls.  
High ceiling.  
Same color and size as the isolation room at the county hospital.
COLE looks around frantically.  
Up, down.  
Where is the VOICE coming from?  
Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...
COLE doesn't answer.
COLE is strapped on a gurney.  
SCIENTISTS hover near-by, whispering.  
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube... reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.
COLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber door is CLANGED shut.
DRIZZLING RAIN.  
And SCREAMS.  
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
What's going on?
Where is he?  SOLDIERS in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit fifteen yards away.  
Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks... in FRENCH.  
COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.
COLE looks around desperately.  
A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  
Machine guns chatter close at hand.  
AAK AAK AAK.  
A grenade EXPLODES.  
Reacting to the foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...
The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.
COLE turns, sees...
It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in the "underground" time.  
He's being carried past COLE now on a stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.
JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.  
COLE goes down.  
Hit in the leg!
SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.
Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.
COLE is reaching for the mask when...
Stunningly quiet.  
We are on a placid campus looking at the dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  
MOVING IN we FOCUS ON a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".
WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.)
until we SETTLE ON...
A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  
On the screen is a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by PEASANTS.  
The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.
WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light.  
She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.
ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc.. ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  
JOSE appears to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until the image approximates Munch's famous painting.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  
This time he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.
As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN, RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening attentively.  
Further away, another MAN listens intently.  
A MAN with shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  
His name is DR. PETERS.
A stack of new books.  
THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is seated at the table signing books but DR.
PETERS has her ear.
DR.
PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE CHANG, appear and whisper...
A full moon.
COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling, "Congratulations" to RAILLY.
She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last cars left in the lot.
The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...
Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the front seat.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...
Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes peering out of the shadows, no other features.
Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.
He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely into her ear, his face last in shadow.
The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.
Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.
As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror, sees him unfolding a tattered map.  
His face is lost in darkness but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.
RAILLY obeys.  
She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully for his reaction.
He grunts appreciatively.  
Relieved, she looks in the mirror again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features are concealed by the map.
Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.
He's lowered the map.  
It's COLE!  
Haggard, unshaven, dirty.
COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.
RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.
The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.
RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily against the seat.  
She says carefully...
RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.
COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.
COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.
COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills the car.  
It's confusing!  
He blurts out... Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her professional tone.
COLE frowns.  
He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.
He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  
FATS DOMINO singing "BLUEBERRY HILL"!  
COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.
As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.
"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.
The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."
RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his head out the window.  
what can she do?  
Just then, while she's trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in... COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.
RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.
It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY".
Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.
COLE'S POV:  the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...
ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.
Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.
The machine switches off.  
The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.
The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.
The TV is on.  
A commercial is just starting.  
A catfood jingle.
The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.
ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side of the double bed, sound asleep.
GUNSHOT!  
YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.
The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.
Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,.
COLE comes awake with a start.  
He stares, disoriented, at the CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.
COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.
COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his impulse.  
He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons.  
He pulls a razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.
Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.
COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.
He heads for the door.
Too late!  
He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.
ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to get loose, tears welling in her eyes.
COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.
ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen.
RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.
COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at COLE.
COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again.
COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.
An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.
ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving, COLE, beside her, staring out the window.
COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS".
COLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!
On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.
Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.
COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang insignias.  
We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.
He pulls her along the sidewalk.  
No question, he's insane.
At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  
Then, still keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens... ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  
He's found another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!
But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.
COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.
RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.
He opens his mouth wide.  
NO TEETH' COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.
COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees... there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS And further on, another red stencil!
CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes, oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.
COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.
Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.
COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!
RAILLY'S POV:  
TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.
RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages, doesn't notice the THUGS.
The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.
These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.
RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.
Too late.  
While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending, the TWO THUGS are approaching.
Startled, COLE turns to face them.
The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.
COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK!  
The FIRST THUG smacks COLE hard across the face with something metallic.
Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S cheek.  
It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.
RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks her roughly to the ground.
Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...
COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.
The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his foot for a second kick when... COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.
The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.  
The SECOND THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.
Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for the dropped pistol.
COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw.  
The FIRST THUG'S head whips back.  
SNAP!  
He collapses against the brick wall.
COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley as fast as he can stagger.
RAILLY stares up at COLE.  
He looks very dangerous.  
He glances in her direction as he pockets the pistol.
As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.
COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.
As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.
COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.
The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him, points urgently at COLE.
But COLE has stopped and is staring at...
A STOREFRONT OFFICE...
its windows covered with posters.  
The sign over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.
Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired, and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  
Behind them, a large poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO".  
Just then, there's a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see COLE and RAILLY enter.
COLE looks startled.  
It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in here.  
Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.
Bookshelves line two walls.  
The front window is blanked cut with posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings, photos of animal atrocities.  
The fourth wall features the counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.
COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets an urgent warning.
COLE'S eyes follow her look.  
It's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".
FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  
"We have a problem!"
the look says.
MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.
COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.
TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.
COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  
A TIGER SNARLS.
MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.
COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  
A BABOON HOWLS with laughter.
RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,.
The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  
They're very frightened, eager to cooperate.
COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while RAILLY watches helplessly.  
Suddenly, COLE finds something he thinks he's seen before.  
He holds it up.
It's a photograph of DR.
MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.
COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.
In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with bumper stickers and painted slogans.  
"I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"...
A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason" rests on a map spread across COLE'S lap.  
COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel, maneuvering in heavy traffic.
COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.
COLE is studying the map again.
COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".
The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open highway.  
COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.  
As the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  
An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE intones over the RADIO... RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.  
She feels so badly for him.  
She wants to help him.  
She says, tenderly...
COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY remain in the car.  
She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.
RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.
RAILLY starts opening the door.  
Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.
She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience Store appended to the Gas Station.
COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  
She's in charge...for the moment.
The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  
We HEAR the CAR RADIO but not the engine.
COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  
He's staring up at the sun and the sky.  
RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.
RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
A beat.  
COLE tries to stand up.
RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  
A beat.
They're very close.  
They don't move.  
RAILLY looks like she can barely breathe.
A beat.  
The spell is broken.  
He reaches for his pants, then turns back to her, suddenly grim.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  
He looms over her.  
He's cold now, steeled.
RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  
Encountering another AGENT, he pauses.
ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.
Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  
He doesn't see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.
A formal dinner for forty.  
Desert has been served.  
DR.
MALCOLM MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.
While GUESTS laugh at DR.
MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.
AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  
JEFFREY MASON!
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.
ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.
The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.
COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the room.  
A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.
Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes.  
A beat.
JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE.  
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
COLE is astonished.  
The AGENTS are, too.
JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.
The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.
GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY and a very disconcerted COLE.
In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.
JEFFREY studies COLE.  
COLE doesn't just talk crazy.  
He looks crazy!
JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.
COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4.
AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.
COLE is like a trapped animal.
He's being led down the staircase now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.
COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the stairs.  
It sounds true!  
JEFFREY'S so confident.
Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free, shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.
COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there!  
COLE turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.
SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS burst into the room.
COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen and look about urgently.
A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.
MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...
Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.
The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.
AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS.
ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.
As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned Acura comes up on the TV screen.
Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.
COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat, spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.
AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.
COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the shift into "Drive", then turns the key.  
Nothing happens.
Panic.  
COLE studies the shift again.
AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.
COLE slides the shift from D  to N .  
He twists the key again.  
The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!
AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.
SMASH.  
The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and accelerates right at him!
AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.
Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.
The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...
COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  
Steering madly, he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.
Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.
AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life, its rotors whipping around.
COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.
He starts hitting switches.  
The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.
Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.
COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.
Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.
The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.
Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.
COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...
A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!
The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.
COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above his front windshield.
Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.
COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  dense woods ahead.
The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.
The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the forest below with his spotlight.
The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.
The headlights are gone.  
Nothing but darkness below.
A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar, crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.
A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.
The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the Jaguar.  
He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees beside the stream.  
The car looks empty.
Total blackness!  
The sound of keys in the lock.
Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight, looking down RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.
COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.
He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.
COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.
Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.
She looks at him.  
Breakthrough?  
Very calm now, the doctor.
COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.
RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.
RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  
An insect!  
He reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  
The HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.
ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.
ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS from the woods.  
The police are almost here.  
She gets out of the car, starts around toward COLE.
She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!
COLE is gone.  
Disappeared.
RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.
A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.
RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped against the alley wall, obviously dead.
YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.
He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he sprawls on the concourse... COLE blinks awake.
All he can see are blurry faces hovering over him, hammering him with questions.
The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.
RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.
A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her bedroom.  
She still looks exhausted   Followed by her cat, she enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily turns down the TV.
The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes the volume up.
RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...
HER POV:  ACROSS THE STREET...
A COP keeps watch.
RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the tea things out.
ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year old boy being led out of a barn by the police.  
The cops look grim.
RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.
VOICES!  
SINGING!  
COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then stares in disbelief....
Crowded around COLE'S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a ragged, out of tune, rendition of "BLUEBERRY HILL.".
Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.
COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century landscapes.
The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.
Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.
COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.
CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,.
RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR.
OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.
Alone in his "hospital" room, COLE struggles without success to free himself from his restraints.
Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and continues his feverish struggle.
COLE looks around in spite of himself.  
Nothing to see but the walls and the landscape paintings.
COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  
Then... Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  
When he speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.
RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.  
Her eyes snap open.  
A beat to orient herself.  
RING.  
She reaches for the phone.
CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
into the phone,.
CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop across his desk, then continuing into the phone,.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.
ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,.
HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.
Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked.  
Then, she hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she finds a copy of her book.  
She leafs through it hurriedly, locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID  in WWI.
Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!
It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in the trenches.  
And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it's COLE!!!
Clean shaven, clear eyed, COLE sits before the frowning SCIENTISTS.
The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves.
The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.
Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white "space suits" work methodically,
DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone.  
His male ASSISTANT, whose features we don't see, stops writing a formula on a blackboard and listens.
RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.
Dr. Mason on the phone.
DR.
MASON hangs up angrily and glares.
We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now.  
It's DR. PETERS, the red- haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be insane to think the world was coming to an end.
But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.
COLE is facing the BOTANIST who's using a pointer to indicate various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.
With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,.
COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects... a magazine photo of wall graffiti:  
"ATTENTION!!!  
POLICE ARE COLE stares at the picture.
LOUD BANGING!  
The storefront window, completely covered with posters, quivers violently.  
Images of MONKEYS covered with electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  
It's RAILLY.
JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.
From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she, seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.
RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.
But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.
RAILLY follows his look.
ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.
LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!"
But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously "tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.
RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.
FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY, and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening between posters at the front window.
Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside.
Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.
POV THROUGH SLIT:  a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front of the store!
ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY, amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.  
He shakes his head wearily.
ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with amazement, too.  
They include... an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated... a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear... an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye... the TEENAGED PUNKS...
a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS, reacting at the sight of RAILLY.  
It's COLE!  
He pushes toward her.
RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.
With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes urgent charge of the situation.
ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:  she tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull him along...but COLE isn't moving.  
He's staring at the front of the FAA Store with disbelief!
COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk, then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:.
It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!
But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past ONLOOKERS.  
She looks crazier than he does.
ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost colliding with a passing car.  
BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.
ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.
JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.
They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  
Is he serious?  
Is he crazy?  
Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.
JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.
JEFFREY exits.  
The others stare at the door.
An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.
The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES COP'S eyes searching everywhere.
Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.
HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,.
A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster, bits of lettuce in his hair.
But she's not listening.  
She's peeking out the alley entrance.
RAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel, The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often, stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.
The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  
Then, he turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.
RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.
ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb stairs.  
As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone, punches a number, speaks into the phone.
COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY pace back and forth like a mad woman.
COLE looks at her.  
She's really upset.
RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.
It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,.
COLE stands, moves close to her.
WHAM!  
The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not holding.  
A menacing figure stands in the doorway.  
WALLACE.  
A wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.
COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.
WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face.  
She flies back against the wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife.
A beat.  
COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.
RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a twig!  
The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
COLE hesitates.
A shadow.  
RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...
Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.
COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to.
HER POV:  
A fire escape leads down into an alley.
RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.
WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.
WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping with blood.
COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.
RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the choice he's made.  
Given up the future (if it exists, and it's looking like it does)!  
Risking his life to be with her!  
For this brief time!  
She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears welling in her eyes.  
But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.
COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.
Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into their doorways.
COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
They come to the end of the metal stairway.  
It's a long distance to the ground.  
COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.
She lets herself down to him.  
Their eyes meet.  
He holds her in his arms for a moment.  
Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
They start running down the alley.
The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  
The UNIFORMED OFFICERS are backing him up, weapons drawn.
No response.
The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol extended in both hands.  
He pans the gun around the empty room.
HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor.
A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the toney downtown shopping district.  
Among them, RAILLY looks furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  
She's hidden her bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody handkerchief to his mouth.
As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling city, the tall downtown buildings.  
His eyes go up.
COLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  
A building with a ledge.  
The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!
ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed entrance to a store.
Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES looming frighteningly close.
A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display window.  
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.  
Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.
COLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone.
ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  
Confused, COLE stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!  
He starts to recite...
Now she's stunned.  
She glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away.
RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.
ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him into the CROWD.
RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.
But COLE'S not here.  
He's a short distance away...staring.
COLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of brand new consumer goods.
ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and full of moldering merchandise.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.
The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!
Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.
The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among them, all wearing black.  
Some of them have climbing gear, tool belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  
KWESKIN is telling his story.
LAUGHTER from all of them.  
Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.
POPE quickly slides the door open.  
It's JEFFREY...grinning.
Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.
The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.
Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.
The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.
The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.
A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.
Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.
Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.
JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.
JEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  
This he hadn't expected.
The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.
It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  
SCOTTY  AND MADELINE.
redwood tree.  
We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say, "1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".
ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the theater.  
WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES.
The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.
From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.
She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...
There are tears in her eyes.  
They discomfit COLE.
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them.
CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.
URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  
Then, METAL ON METAL.
Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen with phony rocks.  
Stalking back and forth.  
Huge.  
Upset.
CLANK.  
CLANK.  
METAL ON METAL.  
GRUNTS of effort, then, DR. MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.
Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.
The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  
From the darkness, unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.
A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.
CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS continue.  
Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie filling his field of vision.
HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  
TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.
ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  
Empty seats on both sides of him.  
He's alone.  
He panics.
A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock Festival".  
PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  
Turning, she reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  
Crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress.
Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  
The BLONDE MAN stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.
The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional, revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  
The Blonde Man is COLE!  
He's confused.
Their eyes lock.  
Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  
She kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other janitorial items.  
COLE responds to her passion as they move deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.
The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than reality.  
Did we really see him at all?
The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished building, deserted in the early morning light.  
High up, a MONKEY his head around a girder.
Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.
Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.
Nothing happens.  
For a long moment.  
Then, an AFRICAN BULL ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.
A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is at the wheel of the cab.
In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.
COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.
RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.
Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.
As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE follows her look.
COLE'S POV:  two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!
RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.
CLOSY ON copies of the mug shot of COLE and a photo of RAILLY while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g.. REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR at one end of the ticket counter.
ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.
ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the bustling airport lobby.
But COLE isn't listening.  
He's looking around, mesmerized.
RAILLY glances around nervously.
RAILLY'S POV:  two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.
COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring glances.
BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.
Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  
Coming to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.
CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter, hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  
The GENTLEMAN walks away.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking nothing like the Railly on the flyer.
COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.
COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next phone looking away quickly.  
COLE touches his loose moustache as he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.
COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.
The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.
Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  
As she kneels to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from the waist down.  
WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR.
PONYTAIL!
The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.
Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly against his face as he leans close to the mirror.
COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  
Nothing!  
Until he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an occupied stall.  
It must be him!
A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall.  
COLE'S answer is loud and defiant.
A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.
COLE looks dismayed.  
This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"!  
And there are no feet showing under the other stalls.  
Did he imagine it?
The Chicago Bulls bag!  
It's on the counter in front of the TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...
COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid.  
He glances around nervously.  
Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking toward the Gift Shop.  
Before he gets more than a few steps, someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.
COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A. Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses.
JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  
Astonished, COLE resists!
Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.
RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it, includes it with several magazines she's holding.  
She doesn't notice MR.
PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!
The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and frowns.  
It's getting late and where's Cole?  
She turns, heads for the cash register to make her purchases.
MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.
The paper features a banner headline...
"ANIMALS SET FREE" and a sub head...
"PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE" over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.
Stepping in line behind MR.
PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch again.
Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY looks up and sees his face.
though it is not visible to us.
Startled, RAILLY frowns.  
Does she know this man?
MR.
PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.
RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do!  
He's
DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...
the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!
Smiling, DR.
PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.
Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops a bundle of newspapers at her feet.
RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS".  
Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.
CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab.  
There's someone else in the picture.  
It's a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!
RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.
RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.
In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions, COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.
COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.
COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now.  
They've got him.
Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.
JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.
She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.
A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.
YOUNG COLE!  
Exactly as he appears in the dream!
He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests down, and they continue along the concourse.  
WE LINGER and DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine, comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.
ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.
ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving along the conveyer belt.  
The bag contains some strange objects.
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.
ANGLE ON DR.
PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.
RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR.
PETERS unpacks his Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of clothes and a Walkman.
DR.
PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.
DR.
PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.
There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  
DR.
PETERS pays no attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.
SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the commotion.
ANGLE ON DR.
PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed glass tube out of the metal cylinder.
Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.
A beat.  
OR.
PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes, and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!
The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing, and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.
Hastily, DR.
PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and shoves them back into his gym bag.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her with his finger.
The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get involved.  
Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.
FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  
COLE'S moustache is slipping.  
COLE senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look.
For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.
DR.
PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.
The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from the floor beside the search table.  
He waves them at DR. PETERS.
DR.
PETERS hurries back for his underpants.
ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.
RAILLY looks alarmed at that.
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  
The FIRST DETECTIVE has the photos in his hand.
ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!
ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR.
PONYTAIL, THE ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.
ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!
COLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"!  
He gives COLE a cold look.
A beat.  
COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.
The ALARM goes off!!!!
The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks him aside like a rag doll.
ANGLE ON DR.
PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.
ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.
ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.
ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward DR.
PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.
YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR.
PETERS hurries by.  
DR.
PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN.
dashing up the concourse, his moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear shot in the crowded passageway.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings, high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  
CRACK!
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.
Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder, steering him.  
YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging helplessly.  
It's too late.  
The BLONDE MAN is dead.
YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears, suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for something.  
POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.
Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS .  
He can't help sneaking another look back.
YOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting RAILLY.  
Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...
she's found what she's looking for!
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded concourse.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.
With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  
WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...
CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS, DR.
PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  
Next to him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...
CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.
DR.
PETERS' POV:  the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman in a business suit, offering his hand congenially.  
DR.
PETERS doesn't know who this man is, but we do.  
It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!
As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS  usher YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.
