Gentlemen , I give you : the Monster of Paradise Falls !
He pulls away the drape to reveal a Giant Bird Skeleton .
Ooh !
Young Carl leans forward , eyes bulging .
And golly , what a swell monster this is .
But what is this ?
Skeptical scientists analyze the bones .
Scientists cry foul !
The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton !

The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight .
Ellie whispers , as if to protect a National Secret .
I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being .

Carl ' s eyes widen in alarm .
You will have to swear you will not tell anyone .
Carl nods .

I ripped this right out of a library book .
Carl Gasps in horror .
I am going to move my clubhouse there . [%@!] I am going to park it right next to the falls .
Who knows what lives up there ?
And once I get there .
She flips through her book , revealing a page marked , `` Stuff I Am Going To Do ``
Past that , the pages are blank .
Well , I am saving these pages for all the adventures I am going to have .
Only .

Carl Struggles to rise from the pile of Ellie ' s things he would been protecting .
I steered us .
I did !
I steered the house !
Steered us ?
After you tied your stuff down you took a nap , so I went ahead . [%@!] After you tied your stuff down you took a nap , so I steered us down here .
Carl opens the window . [%@!] Carl looks out .
Huh ?
The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds .
Can not tell where we are .
Oh we are in South America all right .
It was a cinch , with my Wilderness Explorer Gps .
Russell holds up his Wilderness Explorer Gps Unit .
Gp - what ?
My dad gave it to me .
It shows exactly where we are on the planet .
With this baby , we will never be lost !
Russell gestures , tossing the unit out the window .
Carl watch the tiny Gps unit descend into the clouds . [%@!] Russell watch the tiny Gps unit descend into the clouds .
Oops .
Carl kneels by the fireplace . [%@!] Carl cuts at the balloon strings .
We will get you down , find a bus stop .
You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother .
Sure . [%@!] I do not think they have busses in Paradise Falls .
A small cluster of balloons fly up the house . [%@!] A small cluster of balloons fly away from the house .
There .
That ought to do it .
Here , I will give you some change for bus fare .
Russell follows Carl toward the front door .
Nah , I will just use my city bus pass .
The house lowers into the fog .
Whoah , that is going to be like a billion transfers to get back to my house .
Carl stand on the porch as the house moves down into the thick , dark clouds . [%@!] Carl stand on the porch as the house moves down through the thick , dark clouds . [%@!] Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into the thick , dark clouds . [%@!] Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down through the thick , dark clouds .
Mr . Fredricksen , how much longer ?
Well , we are up pretty high .
Could take hours to get down .
Something flashes by them in the fog .
Carl leans forward .
. that thing was . building . [%@!] . that thing was . something .
Another dark object whooshes past them .
Carl ducks .
What was that , Mr . Fredricksen ?
We can not be close to the ground yet .
A brief view of rocks directly below them .
Carl Gasps .
Bam !
The house Crashes into the ground .
Russell fly off the porch . [%@!] Russell fly onto the ground . [%@!] Carl fly off the porch . [%@!] Carl fly onto the ground .
They land hard .
Carl ' s house is floating away !
Carl runs after the Garden Hose dragging across the ground .
Wait , wait !
No do not , do not , do not !
Carl grabs the hose . [%@!] Carl is Pulled Up in the air .
Whoah !
Hey , hey !
Russell Jumps onto Carl ' s leg . [%@!] the extra weight pulls them to the ground .
Russell , hang on !
Carl slide toward the edge of a Cliff Edge . [%@!] Russell slide toward the edge of a Cliff Edge .
Whoah !
They slide toward the edge . [%@!] They stop .
The drop is thousands of feet .
Carl is Terrified .
Walk back !
Walk back !
Okay !
Russell Pulls Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge .
Carl , still hanging from the hose , looks around .
Fog blankets the mysterious landscape , revealing only scattered rocks .
Where . where are we ?
This does not look like the city , Mr . Fredricksen . [%@!] This does not look like the jungle , Mr . Fredricksen .
The wind picks up . [%@!] they Struggle against it .
Do not worry , Ellie .
I got it .
The wind clears the fog , slowly revealing a crescent shaped , flat - topped mountain on which they stand .
Across it , some ten miles away , is Paradise Falls .
Carl stares .
He can not believe it .
There it is .
Ellie , it is so beautiful .
The landscape is stunning .
Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of the house atop the falls .
We made it .
We made it !
Russell , we could float right over there .
Climb up .
Climb up !
You mean assist you ?
Yeah , yeah .
Whatever .
Okay , I will climb up !
Russell Climbs Carl , stepping on his leg . [%@!] Russell Climbs Carl , stepping on his arms . [%@!] Russell Climbs Carl , stepping on his face .
Watch it .
Sorry .
The hose jiggles as Russell Climbs out of frame .
Now , when you get up there , go ahead ! [%@!] Now , when you get up there , hoist me up !
Got it !
Russell continues to grunt off screen . [%@!] Russell continues to strain off screen .
You on the porch yet !
Russell is just inches above Carl , still Struggling to climb .
He slides down onto Carl ' s head , exhausted .
What ?
That is it !
I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile ?
Aw , great !
Carl paces .
Hey , if I could assist you over there , would you sign off on my badge ?
What are you talking about ?
We could walk your house to the falls !
Walk it ?
Yeah , after all , we weigh it down .
We could walk it right over there .
Like a parade balloon .
Carl considers this .
The house floats against the sky .
The hose descends from the house and `` Y `` s to tie to both Carl . [%@!] The hose descends from the house and `` Y `` s to tie to both Russell .
They wear the hose like a harness , pulling the house as they walk .
Now , we are going to walk to the falls quickly , with no rap music . [%@!] Now , we are going to walk to the falls quickly , with no flash - dancing . [%@!] Now , we are going to walk to the falls quietly , with no rap music . [%@!] Now , we are going to walk to the falls quietly , with no flash - dancing .
Russell inspects his surroundings .
Uh - huh .
We have three days , at best , before the helium leaks out of those balloons .
And if we are not at the falls when that happens .
Sand ! .
we are not getting to the falls !
I found sand !
Carl Rolls His Eyes .
He looks up at the house .
Do not you worry , Ellie .
We will get our house over there .
Russell looks up at the house .
Who is Carl talking to ?
Huh .
This is fun already , is not it ?
By the time we get there , you are going to feel so assisted .
Oh , Mr . Fredricksen , if we happen to get separated , use the Wilderness Explorer call .
Caw caw , radar !
The Wilderness Explorer Call sets off Carl ' s hearing aid .
Wait .
Why are we going to Paradise Falls again ?
Hey , let us play a game .
It is called : `` See who can be quiet the longest ``
Cool !
My mom loves that game !
They head toward Paradise Falls , some 10 miles away .
Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape .
Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks .
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey .
Each has a light .
Hunters .
The prey dodges various Traps , one after another .
A metal cage slams shut , a hidden net , darts on a trip wire .
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks : a dead end .
The hunters surround the prey , stepping out into the light : a sinister Doberman Pinscher , each wearing large , High - Tech Collars . [%@!] The hunters surround the prey , stepping out into the light : a Rottweiler , each wearing large , High - Tech Collars . [%@!] The hunters surround the prey , stepping out into the light : a bulldog , each wearing large , High - Tech Collars .
They surround the prey .
Escape looks impossible .
Woosh !
The bird moves impossibly fast , jumping over the three dogs . [%@!] The bird moves impossibly fast , escaping in a flash .
The dogs head off in pursuit .
A High Pitched Squeal stops the dogs short , their ears wincing in pain .
They whimper . [%@!] They run off .
Carl steps out from behind a shrub .
The Squealing is in fact his Hearing Aid .
Darn thing .
C ' mon , Russell , would you hurry it up ?
Russell plods forward , dragging his feet .
I am tiiiired .
And my knee hurts .
Which knee ?
My elbow hurts . [%@!] I have to go to the bathroom .
I asked you about that five minutes ago !
Well , I did not have to go then !
Russell goes limp . [%@!] Russell lies face down in the dirt .
I do not want to walk anymore .
Can we stop ?
Russell !
If you do not hurry up , the tigers will eat you .
There is no tigers in South America .
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge .
Zoology .
Oh , for the love of Pete .
Go on into the bushes . [%@!] do your business .
Okay !
Here , hold my stuff .
Somehow energized , Russell jams his pack into Carl ' s hands . [%@!] Somehow energized , Russell secures his rope to a tree . [%@!] Somehow energized , Russell tromps off into the shrubs .
He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand . [%@!] He goes into the woods carrying a pile of leaves in another .
I have always wanted to try this !
Carl waits , standing by the tree his house is tied to .
Mr . Fredricksen ?
Am I supposed to dig the hole before ? [%@!] Am I supposed to dig the hole after ?
Eugh !
None of my concern !
Beat .
Oh .
It is before !
Carl covers his ears .
Russell pats down a mound . [%@!] Russell Sighs in satisfaction .
He is about to return to Carl when he spots some Tracks .
Huh ?
Tracks !
Snipe !
Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle , clapping .
Here , snipe . Come on out , snipe .
Snipe !
The footprints continue for a time , then stop .
Huh .
Russell munches on a chocolate bar .
Something Rustles in the bushes behind him .
He turns to look .
Behind him , A Beak takes a nibble of the chocolate . [%@!] Behind him , A Beak zips out .
Russell turns .
Nothing there .
Another nibble !
Zip !
Ha !
Gotcha !
Russell peers into the shrub .
Do not be afraid , little snipe .
I am a Wilderness Explorer
so I am a friend to all of nature .
Want some more ?
Russell holds out the chocolate .
The beak pokes out . [%@!] The beak nibbles .
Hi boy .
Do not eat it all .
Come on out .
The beak zips back into the bushes .
Come on .
Do not be afraid little snipe .
Nice snipe .
Good little snipe .
Nice .
A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell .
.
giant snipe !
Carl checks the knot on his hose harness .
Russell step up behind him . [%@!] the massive creature step up behind him .
I found the snipe !
Oh , did you ?
Are they tall ?
Oh yes , they are very tall .
Do they have a lot of colors ?
They do indeed .
Do they like chocolate ?
Oh ye -
Chocolate ?
Carl turns to look .
Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall , multicolored Bird .
Carl Screams .
What is that thing !
It is a snipe !
There is no such thing as a snipe !
But you said snipes eat - Carl grabs Russell , pulling him away from the bird .
The bird Hisses at Carl . [%@!] The bird grabs Russell back .
It cradles Russell like a baby .
Whoah !
Russell Giggles .
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane , trying to scare it off .
Go on , get out of here .
Go on !
Shoo !
The bird Hisses .
It takes Russell up into a tree , swinging him around playfully .
It looks scary . [%@!] It looks fun .
Whoah !
Whoah !
Careful , Russell !
Hey , look Mr . Fredricksen , it likes me !
Russell !
The bird grooms Russell .
No stop , that tickles !
Carl pokes the bird with his cane .
Get out of here .
Go on , git !
The bird sets Russell down .
It stalks Carl , Hissing . [%@!] It stalks Carl , ruffling its feathers .
Aaaah !
Uh - oh !
No no
no
no no Kevin , it is okay .
Mr . Fredricksen is nice !
Russell pats Carl on the head .
`` Kevin ?
Yeah , that is his name I just gave him .
The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak .
Hey .
Beat it !
Vamoose !
Scram !
Carl waves his cane .
The bird eats it .
Hey !
That is mine !
The bird chokes . [%@!] the cane comes back up .
Aaah !
Shoo , shoo !
Get out of here .
Carl shows the bird away .
The bird mimics him .
Go on , beat it .
Grumbling , Carl gives up . [%@!] Grumbling , Carl throws his hands in the air .
The bird mimics this as well .
Can we keep him ?
Please ?
I will get the food for him , I will walk him , I will change his newspapers .
`` An Explorer is a friend to all , be it plants or fish or tiny mole ``
That does not even rhyme .
Yeah it does .
Russell points up to the roof of Carl ' s house .
Hey , look !
Kevin !
What ?
Get down !
You are not allowed up there !
The bird is on Carl ' s roof .
It swallows a balloon .
It Pops .
The bird coughs up the deflated balloon .
Russell Giggles .
You come down here right now !
The bird jumps down . [%@!] The bird hides behind Russell .
Sheesh !
Can you believe this , Ellie ?
Ellie ?
Uh , hey Ellie , could I keep the bird ?
Uh - huh .
Uh - huh .
She said for you to let me .
But I told him no -
I told you no !
N - O .
The bird Hisses at Carl .
Carl pull the house through the mist . [%@!] Russell pull the house through the mist .
Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail .
The bird follows , eating .
I see you back there !
It `` hides `` behind a rock , still totally visible .
Go on , get out of here .
Shoo !
Go annoy someone else for a while .
Hey , are you okay over there ?
The bird dashes away .
Uh , hello ?
Carl look around . [%@!] Russell look around .
In the midst , some 100 feet away , they see the Figure Of A Man .
Oh !
Hello sir !
Thank goodness .
Carl walks toward the man .
It is nice to know someone else is up here !
I can smell you .
Carl stops .
What ?
You can smell us ?
I can smell you .
As they get closer , they realize the man is in fact a Rock .
Hey .
Russell Giggles .
You were talking to a rock .
Russell points to another rock shape .
Hey , that one looks like a turtle !
Sure enough .
Look at that one !
That one looks like a dog !
The `` rock `` walks forward .
It is a dog !
What ?
Uh , we are not allowed to have dogs in my apartment .
The dog nuzzles Russell , who nervously pets it .
Hey , I like dogs !
We have your dog !
Wonder who he belongs to ?
Sit boy .
The dog sits .
Hey look , he is trained !
Shake !
The dog raises his paw . [%@!] Russell shakes it .
Uh - huh .
Speak .
Hi there .
Carl freeze . [%@!] Russell freeze .
Did that dog just say `` Hi there ``
Oh yes .
Carl Jumps back .
My name is Dug .
I have just met you
and I love you .
Dug jumps up on to Carl .
Uh . wha ?
Dug wears a high - tech collar .
The dog ' s thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker .
It can talk .
Unfortunately , it talks non - stop .
My master made me this collar .
he made me this collar so that I may talk - Squirrel ! [%@!] He is a good master ! [%@!] He is a smart master !
Dug stares transfixed at a tree .
False alarm .
My master is good . [%@!] My master is smart .
It is not possible .
Oh it is , because my master is smart .
Cool !
What do these do , boy ?
He inspects the collar . [%@!] He twists a dial .
Hey would you - - cuerdo con tigo -
I use that collar - - watashi
wa hanashi ma -
- to talk with , I would be happy if you stopped .
Russell , do not touch that .
It could be radioactive . [%@!] It could be something .
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl . [%@!] Dug sniffs the ground around Russell .
I am a great tracker .
My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself .
Have you seen a bird ?
I want to find one . [%@!] I have been on the scent .
I am a great tracker , did I mention that ?
Bam !
The bird tackles Dug . [%@!] The bird tackles Hisses .
Hey , that is the bird !
I have never seen one up close . [%@!] this is the bird .
May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner ?
Yes !
Take it !
And on the way , learn how to bark like a real dog !
Oh I can bark !
Dug Barks .
And here is howling !
Dug Howls .
The bird Hisses at Dug .
Can we keep him ?
Please please please ?
Russell falls to his knees , pleading .
But it is a talking dog !
It is just a weird trick . [%@!] It is just something .
Let us get to the falls .
Carl grabs Russell .
The bird follows , as does Dug .
Please be my prisoner .
Oh please oh please be my prisoner .
Footprints .
A dog ' s nose follows the tracks .
This is Gamma , a bulldog .
Oh , here it is .
I picked up the bird ' s scent !
A second dog : Beta , a Rottweiler .
Wait a minute , wait a minute !
What is this ?
Chocolate .
I smell chocolate .
I am getting prunes ! [%@!] I am getting denture cream !
Who are they ?
Ah man , Master will not be pleased .
We would better tell him someone took the bird , right Alpha ?
Alpha , a Doberman pinscher , sits with his back to them .
No .
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again .
Alpha ' s voice is high , as if he is breathed in helium . [%@!] Alpha ' s voice is squeaky , as if he is breathed in helium .
Find the scent , my compadres . [%@!] you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage .
Beta look at each other . [%@!] Gamma look at each other .
Hey Alpha , I think there is something wrong with your collar .
You must have bumped it .
Yeah , your voice sounds funny !
Beta Laugh . [%@!] Gamma Laugh .
Alpha turns .
They stop laughing .
Beta .
Gamma .
Mayhaps you desire to - Squirrel !
All three dogs look for the squirrel .
False alarm .
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength ? [%@!] Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my cunning ?
No no .
But maybe Dug would .
You might want to ask him .
Beta Snicker derisively . [%@!] Gamma Snicker derisively .
Yeah , I wonder if he is found the bird on his very special mission .
Do not mention Dug to me at this time .
His fool ' s errand will keep him most occupied , most occupied indeed .
Ha ha ha .
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now ?
Sure . [%@!] the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself , none of us will get a treat .
You are wise , my trusted Lieutenant .
Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta ' s collar .
This is Alpha calling Dug .
Come in , Dug .
The screen shows ground moving past : the view from Dug ' s collar .
Hi Alpha .
Hey , your voice sounds funny .
I know , I know !
Have you seen the bird ?
Why yes , the bird is my prisoner now .
Yeah , right .
The screen view adjusts to see the bird .
It hisses .
Impossible !
Where are you !
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back
and then you will like me .
Oh , got to go .
On the collar screen , the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy ' s face .
It is Russell .
Hey Dug !
Who you talking to ?
The video screen goes blank .
The dogs Bark excitedly .
What is Dug doing ?
Why is he with that small mailman ?
Where are they ?
Alpha pushes a button on Beta ' s collar .
A Tracking Device locates Dug .
There he is .
Come on !
The dogs sprint off into the jungle .
The bird drags Dug , still clamped onto it is leg .
Oh please
oh please oh Please be my prisoner !
Dug , stop bothering Kevin !
That man there says I can take the bird
and I love that man there like he is my master .
The bird Hisses .
I am not your master !
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg .
Dug jumps up on it .
I am warning you , once again , bird !
Hey !
Quit it !
I am jumping on you now , bird .
Russell tries to separate them , which pulls on Carl ' s tether .
Russell !
At this rate we will never get to the falls !
Carl pulls on the tether , knocking Russell over .
Carl falls , pulling the house into a tall rock .
Smash !
Carl Gasps .
He turns his anger to the group .
I am nobody ' s master , got it ?
I do not want you here . [%@!] I do not want you here .
I am stuck with you .
And if you two do not clear out of here by the time I count to three - Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl ' s cane .
A ball !
Oh boy oh boy !
A ball !
Ball ?
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls .
You want it boy ?
Huh ?
Huh ?
Yeah ?
Oh oh oh !
Yes , I do .
I do ever so want the ball !
Go get it !
Carl throws the ball far away .
Dug chases after it .
Oh boy , oh boy !
I will get it ! [%@!] I will bring it back !
Quick Russell , give me some chocolate .
Why ?
Just give it to me !
Carl grabs some chocolate . [%@!] Carl waves it at the bird .
Bird .
Bird !
Carl Throws the chocolate .
The bird runs after it .
Carl grabs Russell . [%@!] Carl runs .
C ' mon Russell !
Wait .
Wait , Mr . Fredricksen .
Carl pulls them down a slope .
He slips .
Above the tree line , the house Smashes into a tree .
Daah !
Carl crossing the river balance on rocks . [%@!] Russell crossing the river balance on rocks .
Carl slips . [%@!] his foot goes into the water .
Aaahh .
What are we doing ?
Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves .
Bugs buzz around him .
Carl climbs up the hill .
He Falls over a dead branch .
Hey , uh , we are pretty far now .
Kevin ' s going to miss me .
They climb over a ridge .
Dug are nowhere in sight . [%@!] the bird are nowhere in sight .
Carl sits down on a rock , Breathing Hard .
I think that did the trick .
He turns .
Dug .
With the ball in his mouth .
Hi , Master .
Afternoon .
Carl turns the other way .
The bird .
It Honks at him .
Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl ' s lap .
A clap of thunder .
Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house .
Beneath it , Carl are kept dry , sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire . [%@!] Beneath it , Russell are kept dry , sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire .
Carl looks at Dug , asleep , wrapped around the bird ' s leg .
He rolls his eyes . [%@!] He looks up at the house .
Well , thanks for keeping us dry anyway , Ellie .
Which one ' s the front ?
Russell struggles to set up the tent .
He reads his manual .
Is this step three ? [%@!] Is this step five ?
Carl Rolls His Eyes at Russell ' s ineptness .
There !
Russell struggles with a tent pole , trying to winch it into place .
Carl can not watch .
An off screen Smack !
Russell walks to Carl .
Miraculously , he looks unscathed .
All done .
Russell turns , revealing a large Red Welt on his face .
That is for you !
The tent pole springs loose , catapulting the tent over the cliff .
Awh .
Tents are hard .
Wait , are not you `` Super Wilderness Guy `` With the Gpm ' s ? [%@!] Wait , are not you `` Super Wilderness Guy `` With the badges ?
Yeah ,
but . can I tell you a secret ?
Alright , here goes .
I never actually built a tent before .
There .
I said it .
You have been camping before , have not you ?
Well , never outside .
Well , why did not you ask your Dad how to build a tent ?
I do not think he wants to talk about this stuff .
Why do not you try him sometime ?
Maybe he will surprise you .
Well , he is away a lot .
I do not see him much .
He is got to be home sometime .
Well , I called . [%@!] Phyllis told me I bug him too much .
Phyllis ?
You call your own mother by her first name ?
Phyllis is not my mom .
Carl realizes he put his foot in it .
The two sit silently together , watching the fire .
But he promised he would come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge , so he can show me about tents then , right ?
Carl studies Russell ' s sad optimism .
He looks at the missing badge on Russell ' s sash .
Hey , uh , why do not you get some sleep .
Do not want to wake up the traveling flea circus .
Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird ' s leg .
Mr . Fredricksen , Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner .
We have to protect him !
Russell Yawns . [%@!] Russell lies down on the rock next to Carl .
Can Kevin go with us ?
Alright .
He can come .
Promise you will not leave him ?
Yeah .
Cross your heart ?
Carl looks down at Russell .
Cross my heart .
Carl sits at the campfire , the others asleep .
He shakes his head . [%@!] He looks up at the house .
What have I got myself into , Ellie ?
A frog sits next to Carl ' s glasses .
It Croaks .
Carl ' s hand smacks it like an alarm clock .
The frog hops away .
Carl rises , looking up at the house .
Morning Sweetheart .
The balloons on the house are wilting .
We better get moving .
He scans the camp .
The bird is gone .
Huh .
Bird ' s gone .
Maybe Russell will not notice .
Alright , everybody up !
Russell sits up with a Snort .
Where is Kevin ?
He is wandered off !
Kevin !
Dug , find Kevin !
Dug crazily searches , looking for the bird . [%@!] Dug crazily sniffs , looking for the bird .
Find the bird .
Find the bird .
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog . [%@!] Dug `` points `` to the left .
Oh , look !
There he is .
Russell points to the right .
The bird is on top of Carl ' s house .
Dug turns around .
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl ' s roof .
Hey , that is my food !
Get off my roof !
Yeah , get off of his !
In the distance , Baby Birds call out .
The bird Calls back .
What is it doing ?
The bird is calling to her babies .
Her babies !
Kevin ' s a girl ?
The bird gobbles the food . [%@!] The bird jumps off the roof .
Her house is over there in those twisty rocks .
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks ; the Labyrinth .
The baby birds call from somewhere inside .
She has been gathering food for her babies . [%@!] She must get back to them .
The bird `` hugs `` Russell goodbye . [%@!] The bird `` pats Carl on the head with her beak .
She Hisses at Dug .
Wait , Kevin ' s just leaving ?
But you promised to protect her !
Her babies need her , we got to make sure they are together .
The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth .
Carl gathers up the hose tether .
Sorry Russell .
We have lost enough time already .
Yeah .
The bird rounds a corner . [%@!] The bird hears rustling in the bushes ahead .
She scampers back toward the house .
Russell chews on some chocolate .
This was her favorite chocolate .
Because you sent her away , there is more for you .
Carl rolls his eyes . [%@!] Carl Sighs .
They hear rustling from the bushes behind them .
Huh ?
Kevin ?

Carl protects Russell with his cane .
Dug is conflicted .
Alpha walks forward . [%@!] Alpha stares menacingly at Carl .
He turns toward Dug .
Where is the bird ?
You said you had the bird .
Oh , yes .
Oh , yes .
Since I have said that , I can see how you would think that .
Where is it ?
Uh , tomorrow .
Come back tomorrow
and then I will again have the bird .
Yes .
Alpha Barks angrily .
You lost it .
Why do I not have a surprised feeling ?
Well , at least you now have lead us to the small mailman . [%@!] Well , at least you now have lead us to The One Who Smells of Prunes .
Carl look at Dug . [%@!] Russell look at Dug .
He turned on them !
Dug shamefully lowers his head .
Master will be most pleased we have found them . [%@!] Master will ask of them many questions .
Come !
Wait , we are not going with you .
We are going to the falls !
Gamma Bark fiercely at Carl . [%@!] Beta Bark fiercely at Carl .
Get away from me !

The dogs lead Carl like prisoners . [%@!] The dogs lead Russell like prisoners .
Dug follows .
The house is pulled after them . [%@!] on the roof : The Bird .

The man laughs .
Carl laugh along nervously . [%@!] Russell laugh along nervously .
That is the darndest thing I have ever seen !
You are not after my bird , are you ?
But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar , I would be happy to oblige !
The dogs Laugh uproariously at the man ' s joke .
Well , this is all a misunderstanding .
My dogs made a mistake .
The figure walks out toward Carl into the light .
Carl recognizes him !
Wait , are you Charles Muntz !
Well .
Yes .

Carl Giggles with glee .

Hungry ?
Uh - huh .
Attention everyone !
These people are no longer intruders .
They are our guests .
The dogs Cheer .

I like you temporarily .
You do smell like prunes .
I will not bite you .
Muntz walks into the cave .
Carl excitedly follow . [%@!] Russell excitedly follow .
Wow .
Carl ' s eyes adjust to the dark .
Muntz ' s dirigible the `` Spirit of Adventure `` is tethered in the cave .
I am sorry about the dogs - hope they were not too rough on you .
We were not !
Go ahead . [%@!] moor your airship right next to mine .
Muntz gestures to a pylon , where Carl ties off the house .
Muntz walk up the gangplank of the dirigible . [%@!] the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible .

Oh .

Put him in the Cone of Shame .
Dug Whimpers .
Alpha walk into the dirigible . [%@!] Gamma walk into the dirigible . [%@!] Beta walk into the dirigible .
Dug sits forlornly with a Plastic Cone around his neck .
I do not like the Cone of Shame .
Carl are speechless as they walk into the room . [%@!] Russell are speechless as they walk into the room .
It is a treasure trove of giant skeletons . [%@!] It is a treasure trove of stuffed creatures . [%@!] It is a treasure trove of rare cultural artifacts .
Various servant dogs dust as Muntz leads Carl through the room . [%@!] Various servant dogs dust as Muntz leads Russell through the room . [%@!] Various servant dogs polish as Muntz leads Carl through the room . [%@!] Various servant dogs polish as Muntz leads Russell through the room .
Most of the collection is housed in the world ' s top museums : New York , Munich , London .
` Course I kept the best for myself .
Did you ever !
Will you look at that ?
Oh yes , the Arsinoitherium .
Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth .
Used my shaving kit to bring him down .
A dog approaches carrying a menu .
Muntz waves it off .
Oh , surprise me .
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as `` dental equipment ``
Muntz Laughs .
Behind him , a dog can not resist gnawing at one of the bones .
Oh my gosh , the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise !
Oh , you recognize it ?
I am impressed !
That is an interesting story there .
A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth .
Muntz glances at the bottle .
Hm , excellent choice .
I found it on safari with Roosevelt .
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle .
Pop !
They sloppily pour two glasses .
He fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings . [%@!] I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings .
And did he cheat ?

Muntz Laugh . [%@!] Carl Laugh .
Alpha interrupts .
Master , dinner is ready .
Oh dear , broken translator .
It is that loose wire again .
There you go big fella .
Thank you Master .

So how are things stateside ?
Almost tempted to go back a few times . [%@!] I have unfinished work here .
Please .
Dogs pull back chairs for them .
They sit .

I hope you are hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I have ever had .
Dogs bring out covered plates at the same time . [%@!] Dogs look at each other at the same time . [%@!] Dogs remove the silver plate covers at the same time .
The meals look delicious .
Oh , Epsilon , you have done it again !
Yes !
Russell is served a hot dog .

Carl looks around , still enthralled .
Oh my Ellie would have loved all this .
You know , it is because of you she had this dream to come down here . [%@!] You know , it is because of you she had this dream to live by Paradise Falls .
He gestures toward His House , tethered outside the porthole window .
I am honored .
And now you have made it !
You are sure we are not a bother ?
I would hate to impose .
No no !
It is a pleasure to have guests - a real treat .
The dogs erupt into excited barking .
Treat !
Treat !
I want a treat !
No no , quiet !
Calm down .
Calm down .
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell ' s hot dog .
Hey ! Should not have used that word .
Having guests is a delight .
More often I get thieves , come to steal what is rightfully mine .
Muntz picks up a lantern . [%@!] Muntz walks to the back of the room .
They called me a fraud , those . dah !
But once I bring back this creature , my name will be cleared .
The lantern illuminates photographs , drawings , samples , feathers .
Hundreds of them . all of The Bird .
Kevin .
This is Muntz ' s obsession .
He looks over to a full size skeleton .
Beautiful , is not it ?
I have spent a lifetime tracking it .
Sometimes years go by between sightings .
I have tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives . Can not go in after it .
Once in , there is no way out .
Lost so many dogs .
Muntz is lost in reverie .
And here they come , these bandits ! [%@!] And here they think the bird is theirs to take !
But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place .
Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton .
Hey , that looks like Kevin !
`` Kevin ``
Yeah !
That is my new giant bird pet .
I trained it to follow us .
Muntz exchange glances . [%@!] Alpha exchange glances .
Follow you ?
Impossible .
How ?
She likes chocolate .
Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz .
Chocolate ?
Yeah , I gave her some of my chocolate .
She goes ga - ga for it .
Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell . [%@!] Carl pockets it .
But it ran off !
It is gone now .
Muntz stares .
He walks to a table full of flight helmets .
You know , Carl .
These people who pass through here , they all tell pretty good stories .
A `` Surveyor `` making a map .
Using his cane , Muntz topples a helmet from the table .
It rolls across the floor .
A `` Botanist `` cataloguing plants .
Muntz topples another helmet .
He lifts a third to show Carl .
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls .
He drops the helmet .
It rolls to Carl ' s feet .
That is the best one yet .
I can not wait to hear how it ends .
Carl glances around nervously .
Out the window , sitting on the roof of his house , sits The Well !
It is been a wonderful evening . [%@!] we would better be going .
Carl gets up . [%@!] Carl pulls Russell from the table .
Oh , you are not leaving ?
We do not want to take advantage of your hospitality .
Come on Russell .
Carl leads Russell toward the door .
But we have not even had dessert yet .
Muntz follows behind them slowly , menacingly .
No , the boy ' s right .
You have not had dessert .
Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee .
Carl pulls Russell along , Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream .
Oh , you really must stay .
I insist !
We have so much more to talk about !
A distant Haunted Wail .
Everyone stops .
Kevin ?
Muntz walks to the window . [%@!] Muntz looks out .

There is no choice but to Jump .
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl to leap down the incline , like astronauts . [%@!] The lift from the overhead balloons allows Russell to leap down the incline , like astronauts .

Bang Bang Bang !
Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling .
The house lowers .
Ahead , a giant rock sits in their path .
Carl tugs at the house . [%@!] it Crashes against the rock , pulling Russell onto the ground .
Russell !
Dragging on the ground , Russell gets Bumped around badly .
The dogs close in on Russell .
Alpha bites at his heels .
Carl fends off Alpha with his cane .
Get back !
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down !
The dogs stop short .
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running .
Dug is up on the canyon wall .
He caused the avalanche !
Go on Master !
I will stop the dogs !
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs .
Stop you dogs !
The dogs run around Dug .
Alpha bites Dug by the neck . [%@!] Alpha throws him out of the path .
The bird carries Carl , Russell dragging along behind .
She rounds a corner .

The bird jumps from rock spire to spire .

Give Me your hand !
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can Grab it . [%@!] Carl Pulls him back onto the bird .
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends , but just in time to reach the end of the line - A Cliff Edge .
A river winds 100 feet below .
Carl looks above to see the house ' s momentum pulling forward .
Hang on to Kevin !
Carl grabs onto Kevin . [%@!] Carl picks Dug up by the collar .

Alpha bites the bird on the leg . [%@!] Alpha is kicked loose . [%@!] Alpha falls into the river below .
Carl Lands Hard but safely across the river chasm .
The dogs are stuck on the other side .
Carl painfully gets up .
He looks up at his house .
It is still intact .
He breathes a Sigh Of Relief .
Kevin !
The bird tries to stand . [%@!] Squawks pitifully and falls back to the ground .
Russell rushes to her side .
The bird ' s leg has been injured badly by the dog bite .
She can not stand .
Russell applies a bandage .
From the distant labyrinth of rocks , the Bird Babies call .
Kevin Calls back to them .
She tries to stand . [%@!] She can not .
Russell runs to her side .
No no no !
Kevin !
Stay down .
She is hurt real bad .
Can not we help her get home ?
Carl looks at the bird ' s wounds .
He looks to the rock maze , then to his house .
He knows the right thing to do .
And he hates himself for it .
Alright .
But we have got to hurry .
Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz .
You lost them ?
Uh , it was Dug .
Yeah , he is with them .
He helped them escape !
Muntz snarls in anger .
Wait .
Wait a minute .
Dug .
He leans over a Radar Tracking Device .
Dug ' S Collar Screen powers on . [%@!] a signal zeroes in on Dug ' s location .
Dug , oblivious , looks out over the landscape , sniffing .

What a joke .
Hey , I know a joke .
A squirrel walks up to a tree . [%@!] A squirrel says I forgot to store acorns for winter . [%@!] A squirrel says now I am dead .
Ha !
It is funny because the squirrel gets dead .
They pull the house , keeping it hidden behind the trees .
Careful Russell .
The house bumps into a tree , jostling the injured Bird on the porch .
You okay , Kevin ?
Kevin goes back to sleep .
Russell looks at her Bandaged Leg .
You know what , Mr . Fredricksen ?
The wilderness is not quite what I expected .
Yeah ?
How so ?
It is kind of . wild .
I mean , it is not how they made it sound in my book .
Hmm , get used to that , kid .
My dad made it sound so easy .
He is really good at camping . [%@!] He is how to make fire from rocks . [%@!] He is how to make fire from stuff .
He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings .
Russell smiles at the thought .
And afterwards we would go get ice cream at Fentons .
I always get chocolate . [%@!] he gets butter - brickle .
Then we would sit on this one curb , right outside . [%@!] Then I will count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones . [%@!] Then whoever gets the most , wins .
I like that curb .
He looks up at Carl .
That might sound boring . [%@!] I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most .
They walk in silence .
Carl understands .
The bird babies Call Out in the distance .
Kevin Calls Back .
Look , there it is !
Russell spots the labyrinth , now close by .
He tries to run . [%@!] He is pulled back by his tether .
Laughing , Carl unclips Russell ' s tether .
Hold on Russell , stand still !

Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies .
She runs off ahead .
Carl Laugh . [%@!] Russell Laugh .
Look at that bird go !
Wait up , you overgrown chicken !
That is it , go Kevin !
Go find your babies !
Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth , a fierce spotlight hits them .
Muntz ' S Dirigible lowers overhead .
Run Kevin !
Run !
A net shoots out . [%@!] A net binds her .
She falls . [%@!] She Calls Out .
Oh no !
The net catches on a rock .
Carl run to her aid . [%@!] Russell run to her aid .
Russell , give me your knife !
Carl saws frantically at the net .
Get away from my bird !

Beside them , a group of dogs drag forward Carl ' S House .
Muntz hurls a lit lantern .
Flames burst up beneath the house .
Heat waves ripple up .
Balloons Pop .
Carl ' s house Lowers into the fire .
Inside the living room , Ellie ' s photo crashes to the floor .
Carl panics .
He rushes toward the house , dropping the knife .
Muntz motions to the dogs .
They swarm past Russell , knocking him down . [%@!] They swarm past Russell , grabbing the bird in the net .
Carl pulls his house away from the flames .
The bird Calls Out plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible .

Careful .
We want her in good shape for my return .
Let her go !
Stop !
Russell runs after the dogs . [%@!] the gangplank closes .
The dirigible flies off .
Kevin !
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket .
He extinguishes the flames .
Carl collapses on the side of his house .
You gave away Kevin .
You just gave her away .
This is none of my concern .
I did not ask for any of this !
Master .
It is alright .
I am not your master !
And if you had not a shown up , none of this would have happened !
Bad dog !

Dug slinks off , tail between his legs .
Carl angrily puts on the harness .
Now , whether you assist me , I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me . [%@!] Now , whether not , I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me .
He walks off .
Russell falls in behind .
An angry dawn breaks .
Now barely aloft , Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape .
Russell ' s harness drags along side , empty .
Russell walks behind .
With the last of his energy , Carl drags the house into place .
The house groans as it comes to rest .
Carl drops the hose harness . [%@!] Carl walks to the edge of a cliff .
He looks over .
He is finally made it : Paradise Falls .
Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge .
Carl takes out Ellie ' s childhood drawing .
Next to him stands the real house , just like Ellie wanted .
Here .
Behind him , Russell throws his sash on the ground .
I do not want this anymore .
Russell walks away .
He sits on a rock , alone .
Carl picks up the sash .
He walks up the steps of his house .
The door opens .
Carl steps in .
He is back in his house for the first time in days .
Carl things are strewn across the floor , a mess from the rough journey . [%@!] Ellie ' s things are strewn across the floor , a mess from the rough journey .

He pushes their two chairs back into their place .
Carl closes his eyes . [%@!] Carl takes a deep breath . [%@!] Carl sits .
Quiet .
Nothing , savedag the distant sound of the falls outside .

He looks through the pages , remembering the newspaper clippings , the dreams of young Ellie . [%@!] He looks through the pages , remembering old photographs , the dreams of young Ellie .
He turns to the page marked :
Stuff I Am Going To Do .
Carl sighs .
He managed to bring the house to the falls . [%@!] Ellie never made it .
He closes the book .
But as he does , Carl sees something he had not before .
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank .
A Wedding Photo of the two of them .
On a picnic .
Celebrating birthdays .
Another . photos of their ordinary life together , the ups . [%@!] Another . photos of their ordinary life together , the downs . [%@!] another . photos of their ordinary life together , the ups . [%@!] another . photos of their ordinary life together , the downs .
Carl ' s face warms .
Ellie lived the life she wanted : she saw adventure in everyday life .
A photo of the two of them sitting side by side , together , in their chairs .
Beneath it , Ellie has written : Carl smiles .
He looks over to Ellie ' s empty chair .
On the arm is Russell ' s sash .
Carl picks it up .
He looks to Ellie ' s chair .
He crosses his heart .
Carl walks from the house . [%@!] Carl calls from the porch .
Russell ?
But Russell is nowhere to be seen .
A shadow crosses Carl .
He looks up to see Russell floating off , hanging from a Bunch Of Balloons .

Russell fires up a Leaf Blower . [%@!] Russell steers himself off into the sky .
No , Russell !
No ! Carl runs back to his house . [%@!] No ! Carl tries in desperation to lift it .

Furious , he Throws a chair off his porch .
It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud .
This gives him an idea .
The Gramophone smashes onto the rocky ground .
Chairs , dressers , tables ; Carl throws them all out of the house .
Slowly , one corner of the house lifts .
Then another .
Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch .

The house lifts off !
Wahhoo !
The house floats off into the sky , leaving a huge pile of things .
Beside it sits Carl ' s chairs , side by side atop Paradise Falls . [%@!] Beside it sits Ellie ' s chairs , side by side atop Paradise Falls .
The house soars into the air , sails billowing .
Inside the house , Carl adjusts his steering , scans the skies .
Knock Knock Knock .
Carl ' s eyes go wide .
Russell ?
The door swings open .
Dug !
I was hiding under your porch because I love you .
Can I stay ?
Can you stay ?
Well , you are my dog are not you ?
And I am your master !
You are my master !
Dug lunges forward . [%@!] Dug overwhelms Carl with dog kisses .
Oh boy .
Oh boy !
The house flies off into the sky .
Good boy , Dug .
You are a good boy !
Russell steers through the clouds toward the Dirigible .
Dogs play poker .
Behind them , Russell flies past with the leaf blower .
