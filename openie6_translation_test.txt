There is a divinity that shapes our ends .


Consider the case of Henry Pifield Rice , detective .


I must explain Henry early , to avoid disappointment .


If I simply said he was a detective , and let it go at that , I should be obtaining the reader ' s interest under false pretences .

He was really only a sort of detective , a species of sleuth .


At Stafford ' s International Investigation Bureau , in the Strand , where he was employed , they did not require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police .


He had never measured a footprint in his life , and what he did not know about bloodstains would have filled a library .

Henry lived in a boarding - house in Guildford Street .


One day a new girl came to the boarding - house , and sat next to Henry at meals .

Her name was Alice Weston .

Henry was surprised to find that she was on the stage , in the chorus .

Alice Weston was different .


' I am rehearsing at present ' she said .


' I am going out on tour next month in `` The Girl From Brighton .


What do you do , Mr Rice '


Henry paused for a moment before replying .


He knew how sensational he was going to be .


' I am a detective '


Usually , when he told girls his profession , squeaks of amazed admiration greeted him .


Now he was chagrined to perceive in the brown eyes that met his distinct disapproval .


' What is the matter '


he said , a little anxiously , for even at this early stage in their acquaintance he was conscious of a strong desire to win her approval .


' Do not you like detectives '


' I do not know .


Somehow I should not have thought you were one '


This restored Henry ' s equanimity somewhat .


Naturally a detective does not want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right at the start .

' I think - you will not be offended ' ' Go on '


' I have always looked on it as rather a sneaky job '


' Sneaky ' moaned Henry .


Well , creeping about , spying on people '


Henry was appalled .


She had defined his own trade to a nicety .


There might be detectives whose work was above this reproach , but he was a confirmed creeper , and he knew it .

It was not his fault .

It was hard , and yet he felt the sting of her words , and in his bosom the first seeds of dissatisfaction with his occupation took root .

You might have thought that this frankness on the girl ' s part would have kept Henry from falling in love with her .


Certainly the dignified thing would have been to change his seat at table , and take his meals next to someone who appreciated the romance of detective work a little more .

But no , he remained where he was , and presently Cupid , who never shoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boarding - house hash , sniped him where he sat .

He proposed to Alice Weston .


She refused him .


' It is not because I am not fond of you .


I think you are the nicest man I ever met '


A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled Henry to win this place in her affections .


He had worked patiently and well before actually putting his fortune to the test .

It seemed final , but Henry did not wholly despair .

He was a resolute young man .


You have to be to wait outside restaurants in the rain for any length of time .


He had an inspiration .


He sought out a dramatic agent .


' I want to go on the stage , in musical comedy '


' Let us see you dance '


' I can not dance '


' Sing ' said the agent .


' Stop singing ' added the agent , hastily .


' You go away and have a nice cup of hot tea ' said the agent , soothingly , ' and you will be as right as anything in the morning '
' you will be as right as anything in the morning '
' You go away '

Henry went away .


A few days later , at the Bureau , his fellow - detective Simmonds hailed him .


Here , you !


The boss wants you .


Buck up '


Mr Stafford was talking into the telephone .


He replaced the receiver as Henry entered .


' Oh , Rice , here is a woman wants her husband shadowed while he is on the road .


He is an actor .


I am sending you .


Go to this address , and get photographs and all particulars .
Go to this address .

You will have to catch the eleven of the clock train on Friday '


' Yes , sir '


' He is in `` The Girl From Brighton `` company .


They open at Bristol '


It sometimes seemed to Henry as if Fate did it on purpose .


If the commission had had to do with any other company , it would have been well enough , for , professionally speaking , it was the most important with which he had ever been entrusted .


If he had never met Alice Weston , and heard her views upon detective work , he would have been pleased and flattered .

Things being as they were , it was Henry ' s considered opinion that Fate had slipped one over on him .


In the first place , what torture to be always near her , unable to reveal himself ; to watch her while she disported herself in the company of other men .


He would be disguised , and she would not recognize him ; but he would recognize her , and his sufferings would be dreadful .

Still , business was business .


At five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station , a false beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye .

If you had asked him he would have said that he was a Scotch business man .


As a matter of fact , he looked far more like a motor - car coming through a haystack .


The platform was crowded .


Friends of the company had come to see the company off .


Henry looked on discreetly from behind a stout porter , whose bulk formed a capital screen .


In spite of himself , he was impressed .


The stage at close quarters always thrilled him .


He recognized celebrities .


The fat man in the brown suit was Walter Jelliffe , the comedian and star of the company .

Others of the famous were scattered about .


He saw Alice .


She was talking to a man with a face like a hatchet , and smiling , too , as if she enjoyed it .

Behind the matted foliage which he had inflicted on his face , Henry ' s teeth came together with a snap .


In the weeks that followed , as he dogged ' The Girl From Brighton ' company from town to town , it would be difficult to say whether Henry was happy or unhappy .

On the one hand , to realize that Alice was so near and yet so inaccessible was a constant source of misery ; yet , on the other , he could not but admit that he was having the very dickens of a time , loafing round the country like this .

He was made for this sort of life , he considered .


Fate had placed him in a London office , but what he really enjoyed was this unfettered travel .

Some gipsy strain in him rendered even the obvious discomforts of theatrical touring agreeable .


He liked catching trains ; he liked invading strange hotels ; above all , he revelled in the artistic pleasure of watching unsuspecting fellow - men as if they were so many ants .


That was really the best part of the whole thing .


It was all very well for Alice to talk about creeping and spying , but , if you considered it without bias , there was nothing degrading about it at all .

You could not simply say to yourself , ' I will creep '


If you attempted to do it in your own person , you would be detected instantly .


You had to be an adept at masking your personality .


You had to be one man at Bristol and another quite different man at Hull - especially if , like Henry , you were of a gregarious disposition , and liked the society of actors .

The stage had always fascinated Henry .


To meet even minor members of the profession off the boards gave him a thrill .


There was a resting juvenile , of fit - up calibre , at his boarding - house who could always get a shilling out of him simply by talking about how he had jumped in and saved the show at the hamlets which he had visited in the course of his wanderings .

And on this ' Girl From Brighton ' tour he was in constant touch with men who really amounted to something .


Walter Jelliffe had been a celebrity when Henry was going to school ; and Sidney Crane , the baritone , and others of the lengthy cast , were all players not unknown in London .

Henry courted them assiduously .


It had not been hard to scrape acquaintance with them .


The principals of the company always put up at the best hotel , and - his expenses being paid by his employer - so did Henry .

It was the easiest thing possible to bridge with a well - timed whisky - and - soda the gulf between non - acquaintance and warm friendship .


Walter Jelliffe , in particular , was peculiarly accessible .


Every time Henry accosted him - as a different individual , of course - and renewed in a fresh disguise the friendship which he had enjoyed at the last town , Walter Jelliffe met him more than half - way .

He was made up as an old Indian colonel that week , and he complimented his host on the aroma with a fine old - world courtesy .

Walter Jelliffe seemed gratified .


' Quite comfortable ' he asked .


' Quite , I thank you ' said Henry , fondling his silver moustache .


' That is right .


And now tell me , old man , which of us is it you are trailing '


Henry nearly swallowed his cigar .


' What do you mean '


' Oh , come ' protested Jelliffe ; ' there is no need to keep it up with me .


I know you are a detective .


The question is , Who is the man you are after ?


That is what we have all been wondering all this time '


All !


They had all been wondering !


It was worse than Henry could have imagined .


Till now he had pictured his position with regard to ' The Girl From Brighton ' company rather as that of some scientist who , seeing but unseen , keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of water under his microscope .

And they had all detected him - every one of them .


It was a stunning blow .


If there was one thing on which Henry prided himself it was the impenetrability of his disguises .


He might be slow ; he might be on the stupid side ; but he could disguise himself .
He might be slow .

He had a variety of disguises , each designed to befog the public more hopelessly than the last .

Still later , a rather flashy individual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar .


Would you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely differing personalities was in reality one man ?


Certainly you would .


Henry did not know it , but he had achieved in the eyes of the small servant who answered the front - door bell at his boarding - house a well - established reputation as a humorist of the more practical kind .

The comedian regarded him curiously .


' You look at least a hundred years old ' he said .


' What are you made up as ?


A piece of Gorgonzola '


Henry glanced hastily at the mirror .


Yes , he did look rather old .


He must have overdone some of the lines on his forehead .


He looked something between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who had seen a good deal of trouble .


' If you knew how you were demoralizing the company ' Jelliffe went on , ' you would drop it .


As steady and quiet a lot of boys as ever you met till you came along .

Now they do nothing but bet on what disguise you are going to choose for the next town .


I do not see why you need to change so often .


You were all right as the Scotchman at Bristol .


We were all saying how nice you looked .


You should have stuck to that .


But what do you do at Hull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed suit , looking rotten .

However , all that is beside the point .


It is a free country .


If you like to spoil your beauty , I suppose there is no law against it .


What I want to know is , who is the man ?


Whose track are you sniffing on , Bill ?


You will pardon my calling you Bill .


You are known as Bill the Bloodhound in the company .


Who is the man '


' Never mind ' said Henry .


He was aware , as he made it , that it was not a very able retort , but he was feeling too limp for satisfactory repartee .

Criticisms in the Bureau , dealing with his alleged solidity of skull , he did not resent .


He attributed them to man ' s natural desire to chaff his fellow - man .


But to be unmasked by the general public in this way was another matter .


It struck at the root of all things .


But I do mind ' objected Jelliffe .


' It is most important .


A lot of money hangs on it .


We have got a sweepstake on in the company , the holder of the winning name to take the entire receipts .


Come on .


Who is he '


Henry rose and made for the door .
Henry rose .
Henry made for the door .

His feelings were too deep for words .


Even a minor detective has his professional pride ; and the knowledge that his espionage is being made the basis of sweepstakes by his quarry cuts this to the quick .

' Here , do not go !


Where are you going '


' Back to London ' said Henry , bitterly .


' It is a lot of good my staying here now , is not it '


' I should say it was - to me .


Do not be in a hurry .


You are thinking that , now we know all about you , your utility as a sleuth has waned to some extent .


Is that it '


' Well '


' Well , why worry ?


What does it matter to you ?


You do not get paid by results , do you ?


Your boss said `` Trail along ``


Well , do it , then .


I should hate to lose you .


I do not suppose you know it , but you have been the best mascot this tour that I have ever come across .

A detective is only human .


The less of a detective , the more human he is .


Henry was not much of a detective , and his human traits were consequently highly developed .

From a boy , he had never been able to resist curiosity .


If a crowd collected in the street he always added himself to it , and he would have stopped to gape at a window with ' Watch this window ' written on it , if he had been running for his life from wild bulls .

He was , and always had been , intensely desirous of some day penetrating behind the scenes of a theatre .


And there was another thing .


At last , if he accepted this invitation , he would be able to see and speak to Alice Weston , and interfere with the manoeuvres of the hatchet - faced man , on whom he had brooded with suspicion and jealousy since that first morning at the station .

To see Alice !


Perhaps , with eloquence , to talk her out of that ridiculous resolve of hers !


Why , there is something in that ' he said .


Rather !


Well , that is settled .


And now , touching that sweep , who is it '


' I can not tell you that .


You see , so far as that goes , I am just where I was before .


I can still watch - whoever it is I am watching '


' Dash it , so you can .


I did not think of that ' said Jelliffe , who possessed a sensitive conscience .


' Purely between ourselves , it is not me , is it '


Henry eyed him inscrutable .


He could look inscrutable at times .


' Ah '


he said , and left quickly , with the feeling that , however poorly he had shown up during the actual interview , his exit had been good .

That is to say , he felt like a cat which has strayed into a strange hostile back - yard .


He was in a new world , inhabited by weird creatures , who flitted about in an eerie semi - darkness , like brightly coloured animals in a cavern .


' The Girl From Brighton ' was one of those exotic productions specially designed for the Tired Business Man .


It relied for a large measure of its success on the size and appearance of its chorus , and on their constant change of costume .

Musical comedy is the Irish stew of the drama .


Anything may be put into it , with the certainty that it will improve the general effect .


He scanned the throng for a sight of Alice .


Often as he had seen the piece in the course of its six weeks ' wandering in the wilderness he had never succeeded in recognizing her from the front of the house .


Quite possibly , he thought , she might be on the stage already , hidden in a rose - tree or some other shrub , ready at the signal to burst forth upon the audience in short skirts ; for in ' The Girl From Brighton ' almost anything could turn suddenly into a chorus - girl .

She was not a particularly convincing daffodil , but she looked good to Henry .

With wabbling knees he butted his way through the crowd and seized her hand enthusiastically .

Why , Henry !


Where did you come from '


' I am glad to see you '


' How did you get here '


' I am glad to see you '


At this point the stage - manager , bellowing from the prompt - box , urged Henry to desist .


It is one of the mysteries of behind - the - scenes acoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be heard all over the house , while the stage - manager can burst himself without annoying the audience .


Henry , awed by authority , relapsed into silence .


From the unseen stage came the sound of someone singing a song about the moon .


June was also mentioned .


He recognized the song as one that had always bored him .


He disliked the woman who was singing it - a Miss Clarice Weaver , who played the heroine of the piece to Sidney Crane ' s hero .


In his opinion he was not alone .


Miss Weaver was not popular in the company .


She had secured the role rather as a testimony of personal esteem from the management than because of any innate ability .


She sang badly , acted indifferently , and was uncertain what to do with her hands .

All these things might have been forgiven her , but she supplemented them by the crime known in stage circles as ' throwing her weight about .

To his personal friends Walter Jelliffe had frequently confided that , though not a rich man , he was in the market with a substantial reward for anyone who was man enough to drop a ton of iron on Miss Weaver .


Tonight the song annoyed Henry more than usual , for he knew that very soon the daffodils were due on the stage to clinch the verisimilitude of the scene by dancing the tango with the rabbits .


He endeavoured to make the most of the time at his disposal .


' I am glad to see you '


he said .


' Sh - h ' said the stage - manager .


Henry was discouraged .


Romeo could not have made love under these conditions .


And then , just when he was pulling himself together to begin again , she was torn from him by the exigencies of the play .


He wandered moodily off into the dusty semi - darkness .


He avoided the prompt - box , whence he could have caught a glimpse of her , being loath to meet the stage - manager just at present .


Walter Jelliffe came up to him , as he sat on a box and brooded on life .

Walter Jelliffe came up to him , as he brooded on life .

' A little less of the double forte , old man ' he said .


' Miss Weaver has been kicking about the noise on the side .


She wanted you thrown out , but I said you were my mascot , and I would die sooner than part with you .
She wanted you thrown out .
I said you were my mascot .
I said I would die sooner than part with you .

But I should go easy on the chest - notes , I think , all the same '


Henry nodded moodily .


He was depressed .


He had the feeling , which comes so easily to the intruder behind the scenes , that nobody loved him .


The piece proceeded .


From the front of the house roars of laughter indicated the presence on the stage of Walter Jelliffe , while now and then a lethargic silence suggested that Miss Clarice Weaver was in action .

From time to time the empty space about him filled with girls dressed in accordance with the exuberant fancy of the producer of the piece .


When this happened , Henry would leap from his seat and endeavour to locate Alice ; but always , just as he thought he had done so , the hidden orchestra would burst into melody and the chorus would be called to the front .

It was not till late in the second act that he found an opportunity for further speech .


The plot of ' The Girl From Brighton ' had by then reached a critical stage .


The situation was as follows : The hero , having been disinherited by his wealthy and titled father for falling in love with the heroine , a poor shop - girl , has disguised himself ( by wearing a different coloured necktie ) and has come in pursuit of her to a well - known seaside resort , where , having disguised herself by changing her dress , she is serving as a waitress in the Rotunda , on the Esplanade .

The family butler , disguised as a Bath - chair man , has followed the hero , and the wealthy and titled father , disguised as an Italian opera - singer , has come to the place for a reason which , though extremely sound , for the moment eludes the memory .

Exeunt all , hurriedly , leaving the heroine alone on the stage .


It is a crisis in the heroine ' s life .


She meets it bravely .


She sings a song entitled ' My Honolulu Queen , with chorus of Japanese girls and Bulgarian officers .

Alice was one of the Japanese girls .


She was standing a little apart from the other Japanese girls .


Henry was on her with a bound .


Now was his time .


He felt keyed up , full of persuasive words .


In the interval which had elapsed since their last conversation yeasty emotions had been playing the dickens with his self - control .


It is practically impossible for a novice , suddenly introduced behind the scenes of a musical comedy , not to fall in love with somebody ; and , if he is already in love , his fervour is increased to a dangerous point .

Henry felt that it was now or never .

He forgot that it was perfectly possible - indeed , the reasonable course - to wait till the performance was over , and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to her hotel .

He forgot that it was perfectly possible - indeed , the reasonable course - to renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to her hotel .

He had the feeling that he had got just about a quarter of a minute .


Quick action !


That was Henry ' s slogan .


He seized her hand .


' Alice '


' Sh - h ' hissed the stage - manager .


' Listen !


I love you .


I am crazy about you .


What does it matter whether I am on the stage or not ?
What does it matter whether I am on the stage ?
What does it matter whether not ?

I love you '


' Stop that row there '


' Will not you marry me '


She looked at him .


It seemed to him that she hesitated .


' Cut it out '


bellowed the stage - manager , and Henry cut it out .
bellowed the stage - manager .
Henry cut it out .

And at this moment , when his whole fate hung in the balance , there came from the stage that devastating high note which is the sign that the solo is over and that the chorus are now about to mobilize .

He clutched at her .


She was out of range , and getting farther away every instant .

She was getting farther away every instant .

He sprang forward .


The advice that should be given to every young man starting life is - if you happen to be behind the scenes at a theatre , never spring forward .


The whole architecture of the place is designed to undo those who so spring .


Hours before , the stage - carpenters have laid their traps , and in the semi - darkness you can not but fall into them .

The trap into which Henry fell was a raised board .


It was not a very highly - raised board .

Henry grabbed at the Hotel Superba , the pride of the Esplanade .


It was a thin wooden edifice , and it supported him for perhaps a tenth of a second .

Then he staggered with it into the limelight , tripped over a Bulgarian officer who was inflating himself for a deep note , and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in the centre of the stage as if he had been a star of years ' standing .

The orchestra , unnerved by this unrehearsed infusion of new business , had stopped playing .


Bulgarian officers and Japanese girls alike seemed unequal to the situation .

From somewhere far away came faintly the voice of the stage - manager inventing new words , new combinations of words , and new throat noises .

And then Henry , massaging a stricken elbow , was aware of Miss Weaver at his side .


Looking up , he caught Miss Weaver ' s eye .


A familiar stage - direction of melodrama reads , ' Exit cautious through gap in hedge .


It was Henry ' s first appearance on any stage , but he did it like a veteran .

The hour was midnight , and he was sitting in Henry ' s bedroom at the hotel .

Leaving the theatre , Henry had gone to bed almost instinctively .


Bed seemed the only haven for him .


' My dear fellow , do not apologize .


You have put me under lasting obligations .


In the first place , with your unerring sense of the stage , you saw just the spot where the piece needed livening up , and you livened it up .

She leaves us tomorrow '


Henry was appalled at the extent of the disaster for which he was responsible .


' What will you do '


' Do !


Why , it is what we have all been praying for - a miracle which should eject Miss Weaver .


It needed a genius like you to come to bring it off .


Sidney Crane ' s wife can play the part without rehearsal .


She understudied it all last season in London .


Crane has just been speaking to her on the phone , and she is catching the night express '

Henry sat up in bed .


' What '


' What is the trouble now '


' Sidney Crane ' s wife '


' What about her '


A bleakness fell upon Henry ' s soul .


' She was the woman who was employing me .


Now I shall be taken off the job and have to go back to London '
Now I shall be taken off the job '
Now I shall have to go back to London '

' You do not mean that it was really Crane ' s wife '


Jelliffe was regarding him with a kind of awe .


Laddie ' he said , in a hushed voice , ' you almost scare me .


There seems to be no limit to your powers as a mascot .


You fill the house every night , you get rid of the Weaver woman , and now you tell me this .

' I shall get a telegram from my boss tomorrow recalling me '


' Do not go .


Stick with me .


Join the troupe '


Henry stared .


' What do you mean ?


I can not sing or act '
I can not sing '
I can not act '

Jelliffe ' s voice thrilled with earnestness .


' My boy , I can go down the Strand and pick up a hundred fellows who can sing and act .

I need you in my business '


He rose .


' Think it over , laddie , and let me know tomorrow .

Look here upon this picture , and on that .

As a sleuth you are poor .


You could not detect a bass - drum in a telephone - booth .


You have no future .


You are merely among those present .


But as a mascot - my boy , you are the only thing in sight .


You can not help succeeding on the stage .


You do not have to know how to act .


Look at the dozens of good actors who are out of jobs .


Why ?


Unlucky .


No other reason .


With your luck and a little experience you will be a star before you know you have begun .

Think it over , and let me know in the morning '


Before Henry ' s eyes there rose a sudden vision of Alice :


Alice no longer unattainable ; Alice walking on his arm down the aisle ; Alice mending his socks ; Alice with her heavenly hands fingering his salary envelope .


' Do not go ' he said .


' Do not go .


I will let you know now '


The scene is the Strand , hard by Bedford Street ; the time , that restful hour of the afternoon when they of the gnarled faces and the bright clothing gather together in groups to tell each other how good they are .

Malone got all worked up .

It is the voice of Pifield Rice , actor .

As a matter of fact , it was by trying to lean on it that Spencer Clay got hold of the facts of the case ; and when young Clay got hold of anything , Marois Bay at large had it hot and fresh


a few hours later ; for Spencer was one of those slack - jawed youths who are constitutionally incapable of preserving a secret .


Within two hours , then , of Clay ' s chat with Wilton , everyone in the place knew that , jolly and hearty as the new - comer might seem , there was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply heroic .

It is a thing he does not like to have known .

You would not think it to look at him , but his life is an absolute blank .

Died in his arms .


Absolutely in his arms , old top '


' What a terrible thing '


' Absolutely .


He is never got over it .


You will not let it go any further , will you old man '


And off sped Spencer , to tell the tale to someone else .


Everyone was terribly sorry for Wilton .


He was such a good fellow , such a sportsman , and , above all , so young , that one hated the thought that , laugh as he might , beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that awful memory .

He seemed so happy , too .


It was only in moments of confidence , in those heart - to - heart talks when men reveal their deeper feelings , that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him .


As , for example , when Ellerton , who is always in love with someone , backed him into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his latest affair , he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over Wilton ' s face that he ceased instantly .

He said afterwards that the sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a bullet , and the manner in which he turned the conversation practically without pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting out of the bunker at the seventh hole was , in the circumstances , a triumph of tact .

Matters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell arrived .

To me there was no charm whatever about Mary Campbell .

Not one thrill could she awake in me .


She was small and , to my mind , insignificant .
She was small .
She was insignificant .

Some men said that she had fine eyes .


They seemed to me just ordinary eyes .


And her hair was just ordinary hair .


In fact , ordinary was the word that described her .


But from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton , which was all the more remarkable , seeing that he was the one man of us all who could have got any girl in Marois Bay that he wanted .

But , when you add to all these things a tragedy like Wilton ' s , he can only be described as having a walk - over .


Girls love a tragedy .


At least , most girls do .


It makes a man interesting to them .


Grace Bates was always going on about how interesting Wilton was .


So was Heloise Miller .


So was Clarice Wembley .


But it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real enthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois Bay .


We put it down to the fact that he could not forget , but the real reason , I now know , was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links and in the tennis - court .

Personally , I think that girls add to the fun of the thing .


But then , my handicap is twelve , and , though I have been playing tennis for many years , I doubt if I have got my first serve - the fast one - over the net more than half a dozen times .

But Mary Campbell overcame Wilton ' s prejudices in twenty - four hours .


He seemed to feel lonely on the links without her , and he positively egged her to be his partner in the doubles .

What Mary thought of him we did not know .


She was one of those inscrutable girls .


And so things went on .


If it had not been that I knew Wilton ' s story , I should have classed the thing as one of those summer love - affairs to which the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive .


The only reason why anyone comes away from a summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed is because there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his holiday is up before he can , so to speak , concentrate .


But in Wilton ' s case this was out of the question .


A man does not get over the sort of blow he had had , not , at any rate , for many years : and we had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent .

I doubt if I was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he confided in me .


Why he should have chosen me as a confidant I can not say .


I am inclined to think that I happened to be alone with him at the psychological moment when a man must confide in somebody or burst ; and Wilton chose the lesser evil .

The first intimation I had that all was not well with him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan .


The next moment he had begun to confide .


' I am in the deuce of a hole ' he said .


' What would you do in my position '


' Yes ' I said .


' I proposed to Mary Campbell this evening '


' Congratulations '


' Thanks .


She refused me '


' Refused you '


' Yes - because of Amy '


It seemed to me that the narrative required footnotes .


' Who is Amy '


I said .


' Amy is the girl ' ' Which girl '


' The girl who died , you know .


Mary had got hold of the whole story .


In fact , it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to propose .


If it had not been for that , I should not have had the nerve .


I am not fit to black her shoes '


Odd , the poor opinion a man always has - when he is in love - of his personal attractions .


There were times when I thought of Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , and Clarice Wembley , when I felt like one of the beasts that perish .

But then , I am nothing to write home about , whereas the smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a kind of Ouida guardsman .


This evening I managed somehow to do it .


She was tremendously nice about it - said she was very fond of me and all that - but it was quite out of the question because of Amy '

' I do not follow this .


What did she mean '


' It is perfectly clear , if you bear in mind that Mary is the most sensitive , spiritual , highly strung girl that ever drew breath ' said Wilton , a little coldly .


' Her position is this : she feels that , because of Amy , she can never have my love completely ; between us there would always be Amy ' s memory .


It would be the same as if she married a widower '


' Well , widowers marry '


' They do not marry girls like Mary '


I could not help feeling that this was a bit of luck for the widowers ; but I did not say so .

One has always got to remember that opinions differ about girls .


One man ' s peach , so to speak , is another man ' s poison .


I have met men who did not like Grace Bates , men who , if Heloise Miller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs , would have used them to cut the pages of a novel .

' Amy stands between us ' said Wilton .


I breathed a sympathetic snort .


I could not think of anything noticeably suitable to say .


' Stands between us ' repeated Wilton .


And the damn silly part of the whole thing is that there is not any Amy .


I invented her '


' You - what ' ' Invented her .


Made her up .


No , I am not mad .


I had a reason .


Let me see , you come from London , do not you '


' Yes '


' Then you have not any friends .


It is different with me .


I live in a small country town , and everyone is my friend .

' Not quite '


' Well , what I am trying to get at is this .


Either because I am a strong sort of fellow to look at , and have obviously never been sick in my life , or because I can not help looking pretty cheerful , the whole of Bridley - in - the - Wold seems to take it for granted that I can not possibly have any troubles of my own , and that I am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry .

Directly I got here


I saw that the same old game was going to start .


Spencer Clay swooped down on me at once .

Well , I could stand it at home , but I was hanged if I was going to have my holiday spoiled .

So I invented Amy .


Now do you see '


' Certainly I see .


And I perceive something else which you appear to have overlooked .


If Amy does not exist - or , rather , never did exist - she can not stand between you and Miss Campbell .


Tell her what you have told me , and all will be well '
Tell her what you have told me '
all will be well '

He shook his head .


' You do not know Mary .


She would never forgive me .


You do not know what sympathy , what angelic sympathy , she has poured out on me about Amy .


I can not possibly tell her the whole thing was a fraud .


It would make her feel so foolish '


' You must risk it .


At the worst , you lose nothing '


He brightened a little .


' No , that is true ' he said .


' I have half a mind to do it '


' Make it a whole mind ' I said , ' and you win out '
' Make it a whole mind '
' you win out '

I was wrong .


Sometimes I am .


The trouble was , apparently , that I did not know Mary .


I am sure Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , or Clarice Wembley would not have acted as she did .

The rest of the story I can speak of only from hearsay .


How it became public property , I do not know .


But there was a confiding strain in Wilton , and I imagine he confided in someone , who confided in someone else .

At any rate , it is recorded in Marois Bay ' s unwritten archives , from which I now extract it .


For some days after the breaking - off of diplomatic relations , Wilton seemed too pulverized to resume the offensive .


He mooned about the links by himself , playing a shocking game , and generally comported himself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted candle .

In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the most spineless lack of resolution .


Wilton weighed thirteen stone , and his muscles were like steel cables ; but he could not have shown less pluck in this crisis in his life if he had been a poached egg .

It was pitiful to see him .


Mary , in these days , simply could not see that he was on the earth .


She looked round him , above him , and through him , but never at him ; which was rotten from Wilton ' s point of view , for he had developed a sort of wistful expression - I am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath - which should have worked wonders , if only he could have got action with it .

But she avoided his eye as if he had been a creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street .


She irritated me .


To let the breach widen in this way was absurd .


Wilton , when I said as much to him , said that it was due to her wonderful sensitiveness and highly strungness , and that it was just one more proof to him of the loftiness of her soul and her shrinking horror of any form of deceit .

In fact , he gave me the impression that , though the affair was rending his vitals , he took a mournful pleasure in contemplating her perfection .


Now one afternoon Wilton took his misery for a long walk along the seashore .


He tramped over the sand for some considerable time , and finally pulled up in a little cove , backed by high cliffs and dotted with rocks .

By this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort , and it struck Wilton that he could be a great deal more comfortable nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than tramping any farther over the sand .

Most of the Marois Bay scenery is simply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart .


The cliffs are a sombre indigo , sinister and forbidding ; and even on the finest days the sea has a curious sullen look .

The day when Heloise Miller went golfing with Teddy Bingley I spent the whole afternoon in one of these retreats .


It is true that , after twenty minutes of contemplating the breakers , I fell asleep ; but that is bound to happen .

For perhaps half an hour he brooded , and then his pipe fell from his mouth and he dropped off into a peaceful slumber .

And time went by .


It was a touch of cramp that finally woke him .


He jumped up with a yell , and stood there massaging his calf .

And he had hardly got rid of the pain , when a startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness ; and there , on the other side of the rock , was Mary Campbell .

And he had hardly got rid of the pain , when there , on the other side of the rock , was Mary Campbell .

Now , if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at all , he would have been tremendously elated .


A girl does not creep out to a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy ; and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him ; and if she was unhappy about him all he had to do was to show a bit of determination and get the whole thing straightened out .

But Wilton , whom grief had reduced to the mental level of an oyster , did not reason this out ; and the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties , including speech .

He just stood there and yammered .

' Did you follow me here , Mr Wilton ' said Mary , very coldly .


He shook his head .


Eventually he managed to say that he had come there by chance , and had fallen asleep under the rock .

As this was exactly what Mary had done , she could not reasonably complain .


So that concluded the conversation for the time being .


She walked away in the direction of Marois Bay without another word , and presently he lost sight of her round a bend in the cliffs .

His position now was exceedingly unpleasant .


If she had such a distaste for his presence , common decency made it imperative that he should give her a good start on the homeward journey .


He could not tramp along a couple of yards in the rear all the way .


So he had to remain where he was till she had got well off the mark .


And as he was wearing a thin flannel suit , and the sun had gone in , and a chilly breeze had sprung up , his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical discomfort .

Just as he had decided that he could now make a move , he was surprised to see her coming back .


Wilton really was elated at this .


The construction he put on it was that she had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his neck .

' I must go round the other way ' she said .


The water has come up too far on that side '


And she walked past him to the other end of the cove .


The prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow .


The wind had now grown simply freezing , and it came through his thin suit and roamed about all over him in a manner that caused him exquisite discomfort .

He began to jump to keep himself warm .


He was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time , when , chancing to glance to one side , he perceived Mary again returning .


By this time his physical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his bosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation .


It was not fair , he felt , that she should jockey at the start in this way and keep him hanging about here catching cold .

He looked at her , when she came within range , quite balefully .


' It is impossible ' she said , ' to get round that way either '


One grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly , that the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her .


From where she stood in the middle of the cove , the sea looked so distant that the fact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment merely annoying .


She felt much the same as she would have felt if she had arrived at a station to catch a train and had been told that the train was not running .

It was only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke the silence .


' The tide is coming in ' she faltered .


She looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed a different sea altogether .


There was plenty of it to look at .


It filled the entire mouth of the little bay , swirling up the sand and lashing among the rocks in a fashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her mind - the recollection that she could not swim . '

Wilton bowed coldly . '


Mr Wilton , the tide .


It is coming In '


Wilton glanced superciliously at the sea .


So ' he said , ' I perceive '


But what shall we do '


Wilton shrugged his shoulders .


He was feeling at war with Nature and Humanity combined .

The wind had shifted a few points to the east , and was exploring his anatomy with the skill of a qualified surgeon .

' We shall drown ' cried Miss Campbell .


' We shall drown .


We shall drown .


We shall drown '


All Wilton ' s resentment left him .


Until he heard that pitiful wail his only thoughts had been for himself .


' Mary '


he said , with a wealth of tenderness in his voice .


She came to him as a little child comes to its mother , and he put his arm around her .

' My darling '


' I am frightened '

It is in moments of peril , when the chill breath of fear blows upon our souls , clearing them of pettiness , that we find ourselves .


She looked about her wildly .


' Could we climb the cliffs '


' I doubt it '


' If we called for help ' ' We could do that '


They raised their voices , but the only answer was the crashing of the waves and the cry of the sea - birds .

' Mary ' said Wilton in a low voice , ' tell me one thing '


' Yes , Jack ' ' Have you forgiven me '


' Forgiven you !


How can you ask at a moment like this ?


I love you with all my heart and soul '
I love you with all my heart '
I love you with all my soul '

They say that drowning is an easy death '


' I did not mean drowning , dearest .


I meant a cold in the head '


' A cold in the head '


He nodded gravely .


' I do not see how it can be avoided .


You know how chilly it gets these late summer nights .


It will be a long time before we can get away '


She laughed a shrill , unnatural laugh .


' You are talking like this to keep my courage up .


You know in your heart that there is no hope for us .


Nothing can save us now .


The water will come creeping - creeping ' ' Let it creep !


It can not get past that rock there '


' What do you mean '


' It can not .


The tide does not come up any farther .


I know , because I was caught here last week '


For a moment she looked at him without speaking .


Then she uttered a cry in which relief , surprise , and indignation were so nicely blended that it would have been impossible to say which predominated .

He was eyeing the approaching waters with an indulgent smile .


' Why did not you tell me '


she cried .


' I did tell you '


' You know what I mean .


Why did you let me go on thinking we were in danger , when ' ' We were in danger .


We shall probably get pneumonia '


' Isch '


' There !


You are sneezing already '


' I am not sneezing .


That was an exclamation of disgust '

You deliberately tricked me into saying ' ' Saying ' She was silent .


' What you said was that you loved me with all your heart and soul .

You can not get away from that , and it is good enough for me '

' Well , it is not true any longer '


' Yes , it is ' said Wilton , comfortably ; ' bless it '


' It is not .


I am going right away now , and I shall never speak to you again '
I am going right away now '
I shall never speak to you again '

She moved away from him , and prepared to sit down .

' There is a jelly - fish just where you are going to sit ' said Wilton .


' I do not care '


' It will .


I speak from experience , as one on whom you have sat so often '


' I am not amused '


' Have patience .


I can be funnier than that '


' Please do not talk to me '


' Very well '


She seated herself with her back to him .


Dignity demanded reprisals , so he seated himself with his back to her ; and the futile ocean raged towards them , and the wind grew chillier every minute .

Wilton sighed .


It was lonely sitting there all by himself .


How much jollier it would have been if - A hand touched his shoulder , and a voice spoke - meekly .

' Jack , dear , it - it is awfully cold .


Do not you think if we were to - snuggle up ' He reached out and folded her in an embrace which would have aroused the professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt and drawn guttural congratulations from Zbysco .

She creaked , but did not crack , beneath the strain .

' That is much nicer ' she said , softly .


' Jack , I do not think the tide ' s started even to think of going down yet '


' I hope not ' said Wilton .


She sprang it on me before breakfast .


There in seven words you have a complete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha .


I could go on indefinitely about brutality and lack of consideration .

I merely say that she routed me out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small hours .


It can not have been half past eleven when Jeeves , my man , woke me out of the dreamless and broke the news : ' Mrs Gregson to see you , sir '

I thought she must be walking in her sleep , but I crawled out of bed and got into a dressing - gown .

I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know that , if she had come to see me , she was going to see me .


That is the sort of woman she is .


She was sitting bolt upright in a chair , staring into space .


When I came in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me feel as if I had gelatine where my spine ought to be .


Aunt Agatha is one of those strong - minded women .


I should think Queen Elizabeth must have been something like her .


She bosses her husband , Spencer Gregson , a battered little chappie on the Stock Exchange .


She bosses my cousin , Gussie Mannering - Phipps .


She bosses her sister - in - law , Gussie ' s mother .


And , worst of all , she bosses me .


She has an eye like a man - eating fish , and she has got moral suasion down to a fine point .

I dare say there are fellows in the world - men of blood and iron , do not you know , and all that sort of thing - whom she could not intimidate ; but if you are a chappie like me , fond of a quiet life , you simply curl into a ball when you see her coming , and hope for the best .

' Halloa , Aunt Agatha '


I said ' Bertie ' she said , ' you look a sight .


You look perfectly dissipated '


I was feeling like a badly wrapped brown - paper parcel .


I am never at my best in the early morning .


I said so .


Early morning !


I had breakfast three hours ago , and have been walking in the park ever since , trying to compose my thoughts '


If I ever breakfasted at half past eight I should walk on the Embankment , trying to end it all in a watery grave .


' I am extremely worried , Bertie .


That is why I have come to you '


And then I saw she was going to start something , and I bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea .

But she had begun before I could get it .


' What are your immediate plans , Bertie '


' Well , I rather thought of tottering out for a bite of lunch later on , and then possibly staggering round to the club , and after that , if I felt strong enough , I might trickle off to Walton Heath for a round of golf '

I mean , have you any important engagements in the next week or so '


I scented danger . '


Rather ' I said .


' Heaps ! Millions !


Booked solid '


' What are they '


' I - er - well , I do not quite know '


' I thought as much .


You have no engagements .


Very well , then , I want you to start immediately for America '


' America '


Do not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an empty stomach , shortly after the rising of the lark .


Yes , America .


I suppose even you have heard of America '


' But why America '


' Because that is where your Cousin Gussie is .


He is in New York , and I can not get at him '


' What is Gussie been doing '


' Gussie is making a perfect idiot of himself '


To one who knew young Gussie as well as I did , the words opened up a wide field for speculation .


In what way '


' He has lost his head over a creature '


On past performances this rang true .


Ever since he arrived at man ' s estate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures .


He is that sort of chap .


But , as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over him , it had never amounted to much .


' I imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America , Bertie .


You know how wickedly extravagant your Uncle Cuthbert was '


She alluded to Gussie ' s governor , the late head of the family , and I am bound to say she spoke the truth .

He had an expensive thirst .


He never backed a horse that did not get housemaid ' s knee in the middle of the race .


He had a system of beating the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out the bunting and ring the joy - bells when he was sighted in the offing .

Take him for all in all , dear old Uncle Cuthbert was as willing a spender as ever called the family lawyer a bloodsucking vampire because he would not let Uncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another thousand .


He left your Aunt Julia very little money for a woman in her position .


Beechwood requires a great deal of keeping up , and poor dear Spencer , though he does his best to help , has not unlimited resources .

It was clearly understood why Gussie went to America .

He continued to rave about her for several mails , and then this morning a letter has come from him in which he says , quite casually as a sort of afterthought , that he knows we are broadminded enough not to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville stage '


' Oh , I say '


' It was like a thunderbolt .


The girl ' s name , it seems , is Ray Denison , and according to Gussie she does something which he describes as a single on the big time .

What this degraded performance may be I have not the least notion .


As a further recommendation he states that she lifted them out of their seats at Mosenstein ' s last week .

' Well , Aunt Julia , you know , do not you know ?


Heredity , and so forth .

She was playing in pantomime at Drury Lane when Uncle Cuthbert saw her first .


It was before my time , of course , and long before I was old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it , and Aunt Agatha had pulled up her socks and put in a lot of educative work , and with a microscope you could not tell Aunt Julia from a genuine dyed - in - the - wool aristocrat .

' By Jove ' I said , for I am interested in this heredity stuff , ' perhaps the thing is going to be a regular family tradition , like you read about in books - a sort of Curse of the Mannering - Phippses , as it were .

Have you no sort of feeling for the family ?

If you require another reason , you are going because I ask you as a personal favour '


What she meant was that , if I refused , she would exert the full bent of her natural genius to make life a Hades for me .


She held me with her glittering eye .


I have never met anyone who can give a better imitation of the Ancient Mariner .


So you will start at once , will not you , Bertie '


I did not hesitate .


' Rather '


I said .


' Of course I will ' Jeeves came in with the tea .


Jeeves ' I said , ' we start for America on Saturday '


' Very good , sir ' he said ; ' which suit will you wear '

I can not express it better than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind , as I walked about the place they call Times Square , was that there were three thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha .


It is a funny thing about looking for things .

By the time I had strolled up and down once or twice , seeing the sights and letting the white chappie ' s corrective permeate my system , I was feeling that I would not care if Gussie and I never met again , and I am dashed if I did not suddenly catch sight of the old lad , as large as life , just turning in at a doorway down the street .

The poor old nut looked at me in such a deuced cat - like way , standing with his mouth open , waiting to be congratulated , that I simply had not the heart to tell him that I knew all about that already , and had come over to the country for the express purpose of laying him a stymie .

I will tell you the whole thing '


We opened the door marked ' Waiting Room .


I never saw such a crowded place in my life .


The room was packed till the walls bulged .


Gussie explained .


' Pros ' he said , ' music - hall artistes , you know , waiting to see old Abe Riesbitter .


This is September the first , vaudeville ' s opening day .


The early fall ' said Gussie , who is a bit of a poet in his way , ' is vaudeville ' s springtime .


All over the country , as August wanes , sparkling comediennes burst into bloom , the sap stirs in the veins of tramp cyclists , and last year ' s contortionists , waking from their summer sleep , tie themselves tentatively into knots .

But what do you want here '


' Oh , I have just got to see Abe about something .


If you see a fat man with about fifty - seven chins come out of that door there grab him , for that will be Abe .


He is one of those fellows who advertise each step up they take in the world by growing another chin .


I am told that way back in the nineties he only had two .


If you do grab Abe , remember that he knows me as George Wilson '


' You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to me , Gussie , old man '


' Well , it is this way ' At this juncture dear old Gussie broke off short , rose from his seat , and sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie who had suddenly appeared .

There was the deuce of a rush for him , but Gussie had got away to a good start , and the rest of the singers , dancers , jugglers , acrobats , and refined sketch teams seemed to recognize that he had won the trick , for they ebbed back into their places again , and Gussie and I went into the inner room .

In the passage outside , Gussie gurgled with joy and slapped me on the back .

' Now what '


' Well , you see , as I was telling you when Abe came in , Ray ' s father used to be in the profession .


He was before our time , but I remember hearing about him - Joe Danby .

She coached me for weeks , the darling .


And now , as you heard him say , he is booked me in the small time at thirty - five dollars a week '


I steadied myself against the wall .


The effects of the restoratives supplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off , and I felt a little weak .

Through a sort of mist I seemed to have a vision of Aunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Mannering - Phippses was about to appear on the vaudeville stage .


Aunt Agatha ' s worship of the family name amounts to an obsession .


The Mannering - Phippses were an old - established clan when William the Conqueror was a small boy going round with bare legs and a catapult .

So what Aunt Agatha would say - beyond saying that it was all my fault - when she learned the horrid news , it was beyond me to imagine .


' Come back to the hotel , Gussie ' I said .


' There is a sportsman there who mixes things he calls `` lightning whizzers .


Something tells me I need one now .


And excuse me for one minute , Gussie .


I want to send a cable '


It was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for this job of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American vaudeville profession .


What I needed was reinforcements .


For a moment I thought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over , but reason told me that this would be overdoing it .

I wanted assistance , but not so badly as that .


I hit what seemed to me the happy mean .


I cabled to Gussie ' s mother and made it urgent .

' What were you cabling about ' asked Gussie , later .

Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at a rummy sort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time and , in between , one or two vaudeville acts .

It had taken a lot of careful handling to bring him up to scratch .


He seemed to take my sympathy and assistance for granted , and I could not let him down .

My only hope , which grew as I listened to him rehearsing , was that he would be such a frightful frost at his first appearance that he would never dare to perform again ; and , as that would automatically squash the marriage , it seemed best to me to let the thing go on .

He was not taking any chances .


On the Saturday and Sunday we practically lived in a beastly little music - room at the offices of the publishers whose songs he proposed to use .

Nothing could tire that lad .


He seemed to take a personal interest in the thing .


Gussie would cleat his throat and begin : ' There is a great big choo - choo waiting at the deep '


The Chappie : ' Is that so ?


What is it waiting for '


Gussie : ' Waiting for me '


The Chappie : For you ' Gussie : ' Waiting for me - e - ee '


The Chappie : ' You do not say '


Gussie : ' For I am off to Tennessee '


The Chappie : ' Now , I live at Yonkers '


He did this all through the song .


At first poor old Gussie asked him to stop , but the chappie said , No , it was always done .

It helped to get pep into the thing .

And the chappie said to Gussie , ' There you are '


So Gussie had to stand it .


The other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs .


He told me in a hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of the songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them out of their seats at Mosenstein ' s and elsewhere .

The fact seemed to give it sacred associations for him .


You will scarcely believe me , but the management expected Gussie to show up and start performing at one of the clock in the afternoon .

I told him they could not be serious , as they must know that he would be rolling out for a bit of lunch at that hour , but Gussie said this was the usual thing in the four - a - day , and he did not suppose he would ever get any lunch again until he landed on the big time .

I was just condoling with him , when I found that he was taking it for granted that I should be there at one of the clock , too .


My idea had been that I should look in at night , when - if he survived - he would be coming up for the fourth time ; but I have never deserted a pal in distress , so I said good - bye to the little lunch I would been planning at a rather decent tavern I would discovered on Fifth Avenue , and trailed along .

They were showing pictures when I reached my seat .

that he might just as well stay where he is , the sheriff having a horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour without coughing .


I was just going to close my eyes and try to forget till they put Gussie ' s name up when I discovered that I was sitting next to a deucedly pretty girl .

I was just going to try to forget till they put Gussie ' s name up when I discovered that I was sitting next to a deucedly pretty girl .

No , let me be honest .


When I went in I had seen that there was a deucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat , so I had taken the next one .


What happened now was that I began , as it were , to drink her in .


I wished they would turn the lights up so that I could see her better .


She was rather small , with great big eyes and a ripping smile .

It was a shame to let all that run to seed , so to speak , in semi - darkness .


Suddenly the lights did go up , and the orchestra began to play a tune which , though I have not much of an ear for music , seemed somehow familiar .

The next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in a purple frock - coat and a brown top - hat , grinned feebly at the audience , tripped over his feet , blushed , and began to sing the Tennessee song .


It was rotten .


The poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it practically eliminated his voice .


He sounded like some far - off echo of the past ' yodelling ' through a woollen blanket .


For the first time since I had heard that he was about to go into vaudeville I felt a faint hope creeping over me .


I was sorry for the wretched chap , of course , but there was no denying that the thing had its bright side .

No management on earth would go on paying thirty - five dollars a week for this sort of performance .


This was going to be Gussie ' s first and only .

He got through the song somehow and limped off amidst roars of silence from the audience .

There was a brief respite , then out he came again .

He sang this time as if nobody loved him .

By the time he reached the refrain I was nearly in tears .

In the midst of my agony I caught sight of Gussie .


A complete change had taken place in the old lad .

When I had recovered I tottered round to see Gussie .


I found him sitting on a box behind the stage , looking like one who had seen visions .


' Is not she a wonder , Bertie ' he said , devoutly .


' I had not a notion she was going to be there .


She is playing at the Auditorium this week , and she can only just have had time to get back to her matinee .

She saved me .


If she had not helped me out I do not know what would have happened .


I was so nervous I did not know what I was doing .


Now that I have got through the first show I shall be all right '


I was glad I had sent that cable to his mother .


I was going to need her .


The thing had got beyond me .


During the next week I saw a lot of old Gussie , and was introduced to the girl .

On the following Wednesday Aunt Julia arrived .


Mrs Mannering - Phipps , my aunt Julia , is , I think , the most dignified person I know .


She lacks Aunt Agatha ' s punch , but in a quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel , from boyhood up , that I was a poor worm .
She lacks Aunt Agatha ' s punch .
in a quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel , from boyhood up , that I was a poor worm .

Not that she harries me like Aunt Agatha .


The difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys the impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the sin and sorrow in the world , while Aunt Julia ' s manner seems to suggest that I am more to be pitied than censured .


If it was not that the thing was a matter of historical fact , I should be inclined to believe that Aunt Julia had never been on the vaudeville stage .


She is like a stage duchess .


She always seems to me to be in a perpetual state of being about to desire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the blue - room overlooking the west terrace .


She exudes dignity .


Yet , twenty - five years ago , so I have been told by old boys who were lads about town in those days , she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in a double act called ' Fun in a Tea - Shop , in which she wore tights and sang a song with a chorus that began , ' Rumpty - tiddley - umpty - ay .

' It is rather a long story ' I said , ' and complicated .

Suppose we look in at the Auditorium for a few minutes '

Her act consisted of three songs .

' I like her work .


She is an artist '


' We will now , if you do not mind , step a goodish way uptown '


And we took the subway to where Gussie , the human film , was earning his thirty - five per .


As luck would have it , we had not been in the place ten minutes when out he came .


' Exhibit B ' I said .

It reminded me of the night at Oxford when , then but a lad of eighteen , he sang ' Let us All Go Down the Strand ' after a bump supper , standing the while up to his knees in the college fountain .


He was putting just the same zip into the thing now .


When he had gone off Aunt Julia sat perfectly still for a long time , and then she turned to me .

' It is twenty - five years since I saw you , kid , and you do not look a day older '
' It is twenty - five years since I saw you , kid '

' Oh , Joe !


I am an old woman '


' What are you doing over here ?


I suppose - old Danby ' s cheerfulness waned a trifle ' I suppose your husband is with you '


' My husband died a long , long while ago , Joe '


Old Danby shook his head .


' You never ought to have married out of the profession , Julie .


I am not saying a word against the late - I can not remember his name ; never could - but you should not have done it , an artist like you .

Shall I ever forget the way you used to knock them with `` Rumpty - tiddley - umpty - ay '


' Ah !


how wonderful you were in that act , Joe '


Aunt Julia sighed .


' Do you remember the back - fall you used to do down the steps ?


I always have said that you did the best back - fall in the profession '


' I could not do it now '


' Do you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury , Joe ? Think of it !


The Canterbury ' s a moving - picture house now , and the old Mogul runs French revues '

' I am glad I am not there to see them '


' Joe , tell me , why did you leave England '


' Well , I - I wanted a change .


No I will tell you the truth , kid .


I wanted you , Julie .


You went off and married that - whatever that stage - door johnny ' s name was - and it broke me all up '

Aunt Julia was staring at him .


She is what they call a well - preserved woman .


It is easy to see that , twenty - five years ago , she must have been something quite extraordinary to look at .


Even now she is almost beautiful .


She has very large brown eyes , a mass of soft grey hair , and the complexion of a girl of seventeen .

' Joe , you are not going to tell me you were fond of me yourself '


' Of course I was fond of you .


Why did I let you have all the fat in `` Fun in a Tea - Shop ?


Why did I hang about upstage while you sang `` Rumpty - tiddley - umpty - ay ?


Do you remember my giving you a bag of buns when we were on the road at Bristol '


' Yes , but ' ' Do you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at Portsmouth '


' Joe '


' Do you remember my giving you a seed - cake at Birmingham ?


What did you think all that meant , if not that I loved you ?


Why , I was working up by degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off and married that cane - sucking dude .

That is why I would not let my daughter marry this young chap , Wilson , unless he went into the profession .


She is an artist ' ' She certainly is , Joe '


' You have seen her ?


Where '


' At the Auditorium just now .


But , Joe , you must not stand in the way of her marrying the man she is in love with .


He is an artist , too '


' In the small time '


' You were in the small time once , Joe .


You must not look down on him because he is a beginner .


I know you feel that your daughter is marrying beneath her , but ' ' How on earth do you know anything about young Wilson ?


' He is my son '


' Your son '


' Yes , Joe .


And I have just been watching him work .


Oh , Joe , you can not think how proud I was of him !


He is got it in him .


It is fate .


He is my son and he is in the profession !
He is my son !
he is in the profession !

Joe , you do not know what I have been through for his sake .


They made a lady of me .


I never worked so hard in my life as I did to become a real lady .


They kept telling me I had got to put it across , no matter what it cost , so that he would not be ashamed of me .


The study was something terrible .


I had to watch myself every minute for years , and I never knew when I might fluff my lines or fall down on some bit of business .

But I did it , because I did not want him to be ashamed of me , though all the time I was just aching to be back where I belonged '


Old Danby made a jump at her , and took her by the shoulders .

' Come back where you belong , Julie '

' Your husband ' s dead , your son ' s a pro .


Come back !

I want you still .

Aunt Julia gave a sort of gulp and looked at him .

she said in a kind of whisper .


' You are here , kid ' said Old Danby , huskily .


' You have come back .

.


You have come back and you are going to stay '
You have come back '

She pitched forward into his arms , and he caught her .

' Oh , Joe !

she said .


' Hold me .


Do not let me go .


Take care of me '


And I edged for the door and slipped from the room .

Gussie called on me at the hotel that night .


He curveted into the room as if he had bought it and the rest of the city .

' Bertie ' he said , ' I feel as if I were dreaming '


' I wish I could feel like that , old top ' I said , and I took another glance at a cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha .

I had been looking at it at intervals ever since .

Who do you think was there ?


The mater !


She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby '


' Yes '

' Really '


' They are going to be married '


' Exactly '


' Ray and I are going to be married '
' Ray are going to be married '

' I suppose so '


' Bertie , old man , I feel immense .


I look round me , and everything seems to be absolutely corking .

She is twenty - five years younger .


She and old Danby are talking of reviving `` Fun in a Tea - Shop , and going out on the road with it '

I got up .


' Gussie , old top ' I said , ' leave me for a while .


I would be alone .


I think I have got brain fever or something '


' Sorry , old man ; perhaps New York does not agree with you .


When do you expect to go back to England '


I looked again at Aunt Agatha ' s cable .


' With luck ' I said , ' in about ten years '


When he was gone I took up the cable and read it again .
